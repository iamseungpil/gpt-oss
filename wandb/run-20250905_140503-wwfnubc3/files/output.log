`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!
MXFP4 quantization requires triton >= 3.4.0 and kernels installed, we will default to dequantizing the model to bf16
2025-09-05 14:05:06,905 | INFO | We will use 90% of the memory on device 0 for storing the model, and 10% for the buffer to avoid OOM. You can set `max_memory` in to a higher value to use more memory (at your own risk).

The tokenizer has new PAD/BOS/EOS tokens that differ from the model config and generation config. The model config and generation config were aligned accordingly, being updated with the tokenizer's values. Updated tokens: {'bos_token_id': 199998, 'pad_token_id': 200002}.
