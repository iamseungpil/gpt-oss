    "0": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to figure out transformation rule. We have three training examples with input and output. They all involve 8s as main shape, and we add 2s somewhere inside or around. Let's analyze each example carefully.\n\nExample 1:\nInput grid: 14x10? Wait first example: Input lines: 14 rows? Let's count: Provided input for Example 1: lines: \n1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3: 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4: 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5: 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n6: 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7: 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8: 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9: 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n10: 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n11: 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo grid size 14x10. Output grid same size. In output, we see new 2s inserted in some positions inside the 8 shapes. Let's mark coordinates.\n\nLet's define coordinates row, col starting at 0. Input: 8's appear in a shape. Let's visualize: The shape looks like a \"T\" or \"U\" shape? Actually 8's at positions:\n\nRow 2: (2,1),(2,2),(2,3)\nRow 3: (3,1)\nRow 4: (4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4)\nRow 5: (5,1),(5,2)\nRow 6: (6,1),(6,2),(6,3)\nRow 7: (7,1)\nRow 8: (8,1),(8,2),(8,3)\nRow 9: (9,1),(9,2),(9,3)\nRow 10: (10,1),(10,2)\n\nSo basically a vertical line of 8's at column 1 from row 2 to 10. At each row there are additional 8's to the right forming horizontal segments: at row 2: 3 8's; row 4: 4 8's; row 5: 2 8's; row 6: 3 8's; row 8: 3 8's; row 9: 3 8's; row 10: 2 8's. So shape is irregular.\n\nNow output: The 8's remain same. The 2's appear at positions:\n\nRow 2: (2,4)\nRow 3: (3,2),(3,3),(3,4)\nRow 5: (5,3),(5,4)\nRow 6: (6,4)\nRow 7: (7,2),(7,3),(7,4)\nRow 8: (8,4)\nRow 9: (9,4)\nRow 10: (10,3),(10,4)\n\nEssentially 2's fill the empty spaces adjacent to the 8 shape? Let's check: At each row, the 8's extend to a certain width. The 2's appear to the right of the 8's, filling the space to the right of the last 8 until a vertical boundary? Actually the shape seems to have a \"gap\" to the right of the 8's. The 2's fill that gap to the right of the rightmost 8 in each row until a certain width? But not exactly: For row 2, rightmost 8 at col 3, then 2 at col 4. For row 3, rightmost 8 at col 1, then 2's at col 2-4. For row 4, rightmost 8 at col 4, no 2's. For row 5, rightmost 8 at col 2, 2's at col 3-4. For row 6, rightmost 8 at col 3, 2 at col 4. For row 7, rightmost 8 at col 1, 2's at col 2-4. For row 8, rightmost 8 at col 3, 2 at col 4. For row 9, rightmost 8 at col 3, 2 at col 4. For row 10, rightmost 8 at col 2, 2's at col 3-4. So 2's fill the empty cells immediately to the right of the rightmost 8 in each row, up to some maximum width? The maximum width seems to be 4 columns to the right? Actually 2's appear only at columns 2,3,4 (i.e., up to col 4). But why not fill beyond col 4? Possibly because the shape's bounding box width is 5 columns (col 0-4). Actually 8's appear at columns 1-4 at most. So 2's fill columns 2-4 maybe because they are to the right of the 8's but still within bounding box of shape? Let's examine bounding box of shape: min row 2, max row 10; min col 1, max col 4. So bounding box width 4 columns (1-4). 2's appear within bounding box columns 2-4. So 2's fill the empty cells inside bounding box that are not 8's? Let's check: For each row, inside bounding box columns 1-4, we have some 8's and some empty cells. In output, those empty cells are filled with 2's. Let's test: Row 2: bounding box columns 1-4: cells: (2,1)=8, (2,2)=8, (2,3)=8, (2,4)=0. Output: (2,4)=2. Yes. Row 3: bounding box columns 1-4: (3,1)=8, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0. Output: (3,2-4)=2. Row 4: bounding box columns 1-4: (4,1)=8,(4,2)=8,(4,3)=8,(4,4)=8. No empty cells, no 2's. Row 5: bounding box columns 1-4: (5,1)=8,(5,2)=8,(5,3)=0,(5,4)=0. Output: (5,3-4)=2. Row 6: (6,1)=8,(6,2)=8,(6,3)=8,(6,4)=0 => (6,4)=2. Row 7: (7,1)=8,(7,2)=0,(7,3)=0,(7,4)=0 => (7,2-4)=2. Row 8: (8,1)=8,(8,2)=8,(8,3)=8,(8,4)=0 => (8,4)=2. Row 9: same as row 8. Row 10: (10,1)=8,(10,2)=8,(10,3)=0,(10,4)=0 => (10,3-4)=2.\n\nSo yes, rule: fill all empty cells within bounding box of 8's with color 2.\n\nBut is that consistent with examples 2 and 3? Let's check.\n\nExample 2: Input grid 7x8? Let's count: 7 rows, 8 columns. Input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 2: 0 8 0 8 8 0 8 0\nRow 3: 0 8 0 8 0 0 8 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 8 0 8 8 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow 0: same zeros\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 2: 0 8 2 8 8 2 8 0\nRow 3: 0 8 2 8 2 2 8 0\nRow 4: 0 2 2 8 2 8 8 0\nRow 5: zeros\nRow 6: zeros\n\nLet's compute bounding box of 8's in input. 8's positions:\n\nRow1: cols 1-6\nRow2: cols 1,3,4,6\nRow3: cols 1,3,6\nRow4: cols 3,5,6\nSo min row=1, max row=4. min col=1, max col=6. So bounding box rows 1-4, cols 1-6.\n\nNow inside bounding box, we have 8's at certain cells, zeros at others. Output shows 2's in all cells that were zeros inside bounding box. Let's check.\n\nRow1: bounding box row 1: cells (1,1)-(1,6) all 8's, so no 2's. Output row1 same.\n\nRow2: bounding box row 2: cells (2,1)=8,(2,2)=0,(2,3)=8,(2,4)=8,(2,5)=0,(2,6)=8. Output: (2,2)=2,(2,5)=2. Yes.\n\nRow3: bounding box row 3: (3,1)=8,(3,2)=0,(3,3)=8,(3,4)=0,(3,5)=0,(3,6)=8. Output: (3,2)=2,(3,4)=2,(3,5)=2. Yes.\n\nRow4: bounding box row 4: (4,1)=0,(4,2)=0,(4,3)=8,(4,4)=0,(4,5)=8,(4,6)=8. Output: (4,1)=2,(4,2)=2,(4,4)=2. Yes.\n\nSo rule holds: fill zeros inside bounding box of 8's with 2.\n\nExample 3: Input grid 9x8? Actually 9 rows, 8 columns.\n\nInput:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: zeros\nRow1: same 8's\nRow2: 0 2 2 8 2 8 0 0\nRow3: 0 2 8 8 8 8 0 0\nRow4: 0 2 2 8 8 8 0 0\nRow5: 0 2 2 2 8 8 0 0\nRow6: 0 2 2 8 8 8 0 0\nRow7: zeros\nRow8: zeros\n\nLet's check bounding box of 8's in input. 8's positions:\n\nRow1: cols 1-5\nRow2: col3,5\nRow3: cols2-5\nRow4: cols3-5\nRow5: cols4-5\nRow6: cols3-5\n\nSo min row=1, max row=6. min col=1, max col=5. Bounding box rows 1-6, cols 1-5.\n\nInside bounding box, zeros at certain positions. Output shows 2's in those zeros. Let's verify.\n\nRow1: bounding box row1: (1,1-5) all 8's, no 2's. Output same.\n\nRow2: bounding box row2: (2,1)=0,(2,2)=0,(2,3)=8,(2,4)=0,(2,5)=8. Output: (2,1)=2,(2,2)=2,(2,4)=2. Yes.\n\nRow3: bounding box row3: (3,1)=0,(3,2)=8,(3,3)=8,(3,4)=8,(3,5)=8. Output: (3,1)=2. Yes.\n\nRow4: bounding box row4: (4,1)=0,(4,2)=0,(4,3)=8,(4,4)=8,(4,5)=8. Output: (4,1)=2,(4,2)=2. Yes.\n\nRow5: bounding box row5: (5,1)=0,(5,2)=0,(5,3)=0,(5,4)=8,(5,5)=8. Output: (5,1)=2,(5,2)=2,(5,3)=2. Yes.\n\nRow6: bounding box row6: (6,1)=0,(6,2)=0,(6,3)=8,(6,4)=8,(6,5)=8. Output: (6,1)=2,(6,2)=2. Yes.\n\nSo rule holds: fill all zeros inside bounding box of 8's with color 2.\n\nThus the transformation is: find bounding box of 8's (the smallest rectangle that contains all 8's). Then for each cell within that rectangle, if it is 0, change to 2. Keep 8's as is. Everything outside bounding box remains unchanged.\n\nWe should also consider if there are multiple shapes or multiple bounding boxes? In all examples, there is only one shape of 8's. So we assume only one shape. The rule is consistent.\n\nNow we need to apply to test input.\n\nTest Input grid: 9 rows? Actually lines: \n1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3: 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4: 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n5: 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0\n6: 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 8 0 0 0\n7: 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 0 0\n8: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0\n9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo grid 9 rows, 11 columns. We need to find bounding box of 8's.\n\nLet's list coordinates of all 8's. Use zero-based indexing: rows 0-8, cols 0-10.\n\nRow0: none.\nRow1: none.\nRow2: at (2,2).\nRow3: (3,2),(3,6),(3,7).\nRow4: (4,2),(4,4),(4,7).\nRow5: (5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(5,7).\nRow6: (6,2),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5),(6,7),(6,8).\nRow7: (7,2),(7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(7,7),(7,8).\nRow8: none.\n\nSo min row = 2, max row = 7. min col = 2, max col = 8. So bounding box rows 2-7 inclusive, cols 2-8 inclusive. That is a rectangle of size 6 rows x 7 columns.\n\nNow we need to fill zeros inside that rectangle with 2. Let's construct output grid: start with same as input, then for each cell (r,c) where r in [2,7], c in [2,8], if input cell is 0, set to 2. Keep 8's unchanged.\n\nWe should also check if there are any 0's inside bounding box that are not part of shape. We will fill them.\n\nLet's enumerate each row inside bounding box:\n\nRow 2 (r=2): columns 2-8: positions: \ncol2: 8\ncol3: 0\ncol4: 0\ncol5: 0\ncol6: 0\ncol7: 0\ncol8: 0\n\nSo in output, (2,2)=8, (2,3-8)=2.\n\nRow 3 (r=3): cols 2-8:\ncol2: 8\ncol3: 0\ncol4: 0\ncol5: 0\ncol6: 8\ncol7: 8\ncol8: 0\n\nSo output: (3,2)=8, (3,3-5)=2, (3,6)=8,(3,7)=8,(3,8)=2.\n\nRow 4 (r=4): cols 2-8:\ncol2: 8\ncol3: 0\ncol4: 8\ncol5: 0\ncol6: 0\ncol7: 8\ncol8: 0\n\nOutput: (4,2)=8,(4,3)=2,(4,4)=8,(4,5)=2,(4,6)=2,(4,7)=8,(4,8)=2.\n\nRow 5 (r=5): cols 2-8:\ncol2: 8\ncol3: 8\ncol4: 8\ncol5: 0\ncol6: 0\ncol7: 8\ncol8: 0\n\nOutput: (5,2)=8,(5,3)=8,(5,4)=8,(5,5)=2,(5,6)=2,(5,7)=8,(5,8)=2.\n\nRow 6 (r=6): cols 2-8:\ncol2: 8\ncol3: 8\ncol4: 8\ncol5: 8\ncol6: 0\ncol7: 8\ncol8: 8\n\nOutput: (6,2)=8,(6,3)=8,(6,4)=8,(6,5)=8,(6,6)=2,(6,7)=8,(6,8)=8.\n\nRow 7 (r=7): cols 2-8:\ncol2: 8\ncol3: 8\ncol4: 8\ncol5: 8\ncol6: 8\ncol7: 8\ncol8: 8\n\nAll 8's. So no changes.\n\nNow we need to produce full output grid: 9 rows x 11 columns. For rows outside bounding box (rows 0,1,8), they remain all zeros. For columns outside bounding box (col 0-1, col 9-10) remain zeros for all rows.\n\nThus final output grid:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0? Wait we need to fill columns 2-8 with 8 at col2 and 2's at 3-8. So row2: col0=0, col1=0, col2=8, col3=2, col4=2, col5=2, col6=2, col7=2, col8=2, col9=0, col10=0. So row2: 0 0 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0.\n\nRow3: 0 0 8 2 2 2 8 8 2 0 0. Wait check: col2=8, col3=2, col4=2, col5=2, col6=8, col7=8, col8=2, col9=0, col10=0. So row3: 0 0 8 2 2 2 8 8 2 0 0.\n\nRow4: 0 0 8 2 8 2 2 8 2 0 0. Let's verify: col2=8, col3=2, col4=8, col5=2, col6=2, col7=8, col8=2. So row4: 0 0 8 2 8 2 2 8 2 0 0.\n\nRow5: 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 8 2 0 0. Wait check: col2=8, col3=8, col4=8, col5=2, col6=2, col7=8, col8=2. So row5: 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 8 2 0 0.\n\nRow6: 0 0 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0. Wait check: col2=8, col3=8, col4=8, col5=8, col6=2, col7=8, col8=8. So row6: 0 0 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0.\n\nRow7: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0.\n\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nLet's double-check row 6: Did we correctly fill col6? In input row6 col6 is 0, so fill 2. Yes.\n\nCheck row 3: Input row3 col8 is 0, so fill 2. Yes.\n\nCheck row 4: Input row4 col5 is 0, fill 2. col6 is 0, fill 2. col8 is 0, fill 2. Good.\n\nCheck row 5: Input row5 col5=0, col6=0, col8=0. Good.\n\nCheck row 2: Input row2 col3-8 all 0. Good.\n\nNow check that we didn't inadvertently change any 8's to 2. No.\n\nThus final output grid is as above.\n\nLet's format output as lines of numbers separated by space.\n\nWe should double-check if any other rules might apply: maybe we need to fill only interior cells that are not on the boundary? But examples show all zeros inside bounding box are filled. So this is correct.\n\nDouble-check test input: Are there any 8's outside bounding box? No, all 8's are within bounding box. So bounding box covers all 8's.\n\nCheck bounding box: min row=2, max row=7; min col=2, max col=8. Yes.\n\nNow we produce output.\n\nBut we should double-check the input to ensure we didn't misread any 8's or zeros.\n\nLet's re-list input lines with indices:\n\nRow0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => all zeros.\n\nRow1: same.\n\nRow2: \"0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 8 at col2.\n\nRow3: \"0 0 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0\" => 8 at col2, col6, col7.\n\nRow4: \"0 0 8 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0\" => 8 at col2, col4, col7.\n\nRow5: \"0 0 8 8 8 0 0 8 0 0 0\" => 8 at col2, col3, col4, col7.\n\nRow6: \"0 0 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 0 0\" => 8 at col2, col3, col4, col5, col7, col8.\n\nRow7: \"0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0\" => 8 at col2, col3, col4, col5, col6, col7, col8.\n\nRow8: all zeros.\n\nYes.\n\nSo bounding box covers rows 2-7, cols 2-8.\n\nNow produce output grid:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 8 2 2 2 8 8 2 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 8 2 8 2 2 8 2 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 8 2 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nDouble-check row 5: Did we misplace 8's? Input row5 had 8 at col2,3,4,7. So output row5: col2=8, col3=8, col4=8, col5=2, col6=2, col7=8, col8=2. Yes.\n\nDouble-check row 6: Input row6 had 8 at col2,3,4,5,7,8. So output row6: col2=8, col3=8, col4=8, col5=8, col6=2, col7=8, col8=8. Yes.\n\nDouble-check row 4: Input row4 had 8 at col2,4,7. So output row4: col2=8, col3=2, col4=8, col5=2, col6=2, col7=8, col8=2. Yes.\n\nDouble-check row 3: Input row3 had 8 at col2,6,7. So output row3: col2=8, col3=2, col4=2, col5=2, col6=8, col7=8, col8=2. Yes.\n\nDouble-check row 2: Input row2 had 8 at col2. So output row2: col2=8, col3-8=2. Yes.\n\nDouble-check row 7: Input row7 had 8 at col2-8. So output row7: all 8's. Yes.\n\nThus final output grid is as above.\n\nLet's produce final answer.\n\nBut before finalizing, let's think if there could be any nuance: For example, maybe we should fill zeros that are interior to the shape but not on the border? But examples show we fill all zeros inside bounding box, including border positions. So consistent.\n\nEdge cases: The bounding box includes all 8's. In example 1, bounding box rows 2-10, cols 1-4. The zeros inside bounding box were exactly the positions we filled. Good.\n\nThus answer is correct.\n\nWe need to output the grid as lines of numbers separated by spaces.\n\nThus final answer:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 8 2 2 2 8 8 2 0 0\n0 0 8 2 8 2 2 8 2 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 2 2 8 2 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nDouble-check row 6: We have 0 0 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0. Yes.\n\nDouble-check row 5: 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 8 2 0 0.\n\nEverything looks good.\n\nThus final answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 8 2 2 2 8 8 2 0 0\n0 0 8 2 8 2 2 8 2 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 2 2 8 2 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0<|return|>"
