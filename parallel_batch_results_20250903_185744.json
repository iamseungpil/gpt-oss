      "result": "analysis<|message|>We need to understand what the ARC puzzle is doing. We have three training examples with input and output grids. The grids contain zeros and 8s in input, and zeros, 8, and 2 in outputs. It appears that some region of 8's has been filled with 2's inside certain shapes.\n\nLet's analyze each example carefully. We'll parse the input and outputs.\n\n**Example 0?** Actually Example 1 given first:\n\nInput:\n\nRow indices from 0 to maybe 13? Let's index them.\n\nGiven lines:\n\n```\n0  ... (14 rows)\n```\n\nWait let's copy:\n\nExample 01 Input:\n\nRow0: 0...10 zeros? Provided \"0  0 ...\" 10 numbers? Let's count: \n`0 1 2 ...` but let's count manually: \"0\" repeated 10 times? Yes it seems 10 columns. There are 14 rows. So grid size 14x10.\n\nBut we don't need exact dims, just patterns.\n\nIn input, there's a vertical column of 0's then a column of '8's starting at row2 column1? Wait reading: Row2: `0 9? Wait actual: \" 0   8   0\"? Let's re-evaluate.\n\nActually let's write out the input for Example 01 more clearly:\n\nRows:\n\nRow 0: `00 0 ... 0` - all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros\n\nRow 2: \" `0   ?` Wait line: \"\u00a0\u00a00 \u00a08 \u00a00\"? Let\u2019s read exactly: `\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08\u00a0\u00a08?` I'm not sure. Let's rewrite using index positions.\n\nBetter approach: I'll copy the entire block:\n\n```\n\n0 0000 00 00\n...\n```\n\nOk this is messy.\n\nAlternate approach: Let's treat as conceptual: In these tasks, typically we have a shape formed by color 8 that encloses empty spaces; we fill interior cells with 0 or 2 accordingly. For instance, maybe we need to fill holes inside the shape with color 2. The shape might be like a rectangle or shape of 4-connected 8-cells. Then we fill its interior with 1 or 0 based on something else.\n\nExamining Example 2:\n\nInput (size 7x8):\n\n```\nrow0:0 7 zeros\nrow1:0,8,8,...,8\nrow2:0 ,8,0,  8 ,8 ,0 , 8?\n```\n\nLet's detail:\n\nExample2 Input:\n```\nRow0 : 0,0 ,0, ,0?? Wait it's 8 numbers: \"8 4? Wait let's re-check.\n\nGiven text:\n\nInput:\n```\n\n```\n    0      0     0    1\n    8      8     8    ...\n```\n\nNo.\n\nLet's rewrite systematically:\n\nExample two Input lines:\n\nLine1: ` 0       0        0          0         0           0            0             0`\nI think there are 8 columns.\n\nBut I will try to reconstruct the grid accurately from the textual representation.\n\nThe given input lines for Example2:\n\n`` `\nInput:\n    00000000\n    ??? \n```\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe easier: Use the output differences between input and expected output. We can see where 2s appear relative to 8 shapes.\n\nExamine Example 3 Output vs Input: Many 2 cells appear inside the cluster of 1's? Actually 8 remains same except new 2 inserted inside. That suggests we fill the interior of a shape defined by 8 border with 3?\n\nCheck Example3:\n\nInput: 8 shape forms a kind of ring? Let's list coordinates:\n\nGrid 8x8? Actually given 9 rows (index 0..8). Let's transcribe:\n\nInput Example3:\nRow0 all zeros.\nRow1:  `0,2? No 8? Wait row1: \"   2?\".\n\nFrom text:\n\n`` \n0  | 0 | 2 | 8 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6\n```\n\nStop.\n\nLet's step back. This is too confusing.\n\nMaybe better to interpret by logic: These tasks often involve filling holes of shapes of one color with another color. Eg. Find all closed loops of 2 (or 8) and fill their interior with color X.\n\nLooking at Example 02: Input has many 8 forming a shape that looks like a thick outline of something. Output adds 2 inside that shape. Indeed 2 appears near center of shape.\n\nSo rule: Fill interior of largest 8-shape with 8 replaced by 2.\n\nSpecifically: All cells inside the bounding polygon of 3D? But",

Input is 3x4? Yes all inputs appear to be three rows of four numbers (3x? 4?). Let's confirm:\n\nExample #1 Input appears to have 3 rows:\n\nRow1: `9 3?` Wait let's see.\n\nGiven in Example \u2460 Output has 6 lines each with 4 numbers. So output is double height? 6 vs 3 input. That suggests duplication vertically.\n\nCheck Example \u2461 Output also 6 x 4.\n\nSo rule: Expand input into 6-row output by repeating rows or something.\n\nLook at Example \u2462 Input: also 3 x 3 maybe? Wait Example 3 Input shows 3 lines each of 3 numbers? Let's check:\n\nExample3 Input:\n`9 \u202f4 \u202f9 \u00a04\n 9\u202f9\u202f4\u202f4\n\u00a04\u202f 4\u202f\u00a04\u00a04`\nYes that's 3\u00d74? Wait first row: 4 items:  \uff19 \uff14 \uff19\u00a0\uff14 -> 4 values. second row: \"\uff19 \uff19\u3000\uff14 \uff14\" -> 3?? Actually 4. third row: \u201c\uff14 4\u3000\uff14\u30004\u201d -> 5?? Wait let's count: 3rd row: '4 \uff14\u3000\uff14\u00a04' - maybe 4 elements: \uff14, \uff14 , \uff14? Eh.\n\nIt seems all inputs are 3 \u00d7 4 (3 rows, each 4 integers). Indeed Example 4 Input:\n\n`3  3\u00a0 \uff15\u00a0 \u06f5\n \uff13 \uff15 \uff15   3 \n \uff15\u3000\uff15 \uff13\u00a0\uff13` -> 6? Wait but again 3*4.\n\nThus each input grid is 4-column width, 3-row tall. Output grid appears to be double height: 6\u00d74.\n\nGoal: produce a new grid that duplicates rows with some transformation like flipping or rotating.\n\nLet's analyze each example in detail.\n\nWe'll parse them properly.\n\nI'll transcribe each example's input and",
