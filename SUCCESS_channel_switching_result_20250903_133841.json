    "0": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to figure rule from examples. Both examples have input with patterns of 1's forming shapes. Output adds 8's in some positions inside shapes. Likely fill the interior of shapes with color 8.\n\nObservations: Example 1: There are multiple shapes of 1's (maybe rectangles or cross). The output: 8's appear inside the shapes, replacing 0s inside the boundary. Also 8's appear on the boundary? Let's examine a small region: In example 1 input row1: all zeros. Output row1 has a single 8 at column 15 (0-index?). Actually row0 col15 (0-index) has 8. In input row0 col15 was 0. That suggests maybe 8's are placed at center of each shape? But there are many shapes.\n\nLet's analyze shape detection: The 1's seem to form rectangular blocks. Eg first block: rows1-6 columns2-8? Let's check: Input row1: columns 2-8 are 1. Row2: col2 and col8 are 1, others 0. Row3: col8 1. Row4: same as row2. Row5: col2-8 1. So shape is like a 6x7 rectangle with hollow center? Actually rows1-5 form a 5x7 rectangle with interior zeros? Row2-4 have only boundary 1s at col2 and col8. So it's a rectangular outline. In output, that rectangle is filled with 8's inside: rows2-4 columns3-7 become 8. Row1 and row5 remain 1s. Row2 col2 and col8 remain 1. Row3 col8 remains 1? Wait output row3 col8 is 1? Output row3: \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 ...\" Actually row3 col0-7 are 8? Wait row3 is row index 3: output shows \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 ...\". So entire row 3 columns0-7 are 8. That seems weird: The rectangle extended left to col0? Let's analyze properly.\n\nBetter to reconstruct shapes: Input 1: let's index columns 0-27 (since 28 columns). Row1: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\". So row1 has 1s at columns2-8, and columns19-26. So two separate horizontal bars. Row2: \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\". So columns2,8,19,26. Row3: columns8,19. Row4: same as row2. Row5: columns2-8,19-26. So we have two rectangular outlines: left block columns2-8 rows1-5, right block columns19-26 rows1-5. In output, these blocks become filled with 8 inside. Let's check output row3: \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0\". Wait row3 has 8s at columns0-7? That's left of the block. But maybe due to earlier 0's? Wait maybe the output has 8's across entire left side of grid? Actually row3 columns0-7 are 8. That seems like a horizontal line of 8's across left side of grid. That seems like the 8's fill the entire left side? But maybe the 8's are placed along the border of each rectangle? Let's examine: Row3 col0-7 8. In input row3 col0-7 were zeros. So 8's appear outside the rectangle. That suggests maybe the rule is to draw a border of 8's around each rectangle of 1s, not fill interior. Let's test: The left rectangle's border: top row1 col2-8 are 1; bottom row5 col2-8 are 1; left column col2 rows1-5 are 1; right column col8 rows1-5 are 1. The border is already 1s. So adding 8's along the border would overlap? But output row3 col2 and col8 remain 1. Row3 col0-7 are 8, but that is outside border. So maybe 8's are drawn along the outline of the shape but at a distance? Actually row3 col0-7 includes col2-7? Wait row3 col2-7 are 8? But output row3 col2-7 are 8. But border at col2 is 1, so 8 would overlap? Let's check output row3 col2: In output row3, col2 is 8? Let's index: row3: \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 ...\" So col0-7 all 8. So col2 is 8, but input had 1 at col2. So the 1 is overwritten by 8? Actually output row3 col2 changed from 1 to 8. But in output row2, col2 remains 1. Let's check output row2: \"0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 ...\" So row2 col2 remains 1. So the 1 at row3 col2 changed to 8, but row2 col2 remains 1. That seems inconsistent.\n\nLet's re-evaluate: maybe I misinterpret row numbers. The output row index 3 corresponds to original row3? Yes. So row3 col2 originally 1, output changed to 8. So the shape's border changed partially.\n\nThus maybe the rule is to fill the interior of each shape with 8 and keep the boundary 1s but maybe shift boundary? Let's analyze more.\n\nIn left rectangle, interior cells are rows2-4, columns3-7. In output, those cells are 8. Good. But what about row3 col2? That's boundary left column. Should remain 1. But output shows 8. So maybe the boundary is moved one cell inward? Actually the output seems to have the rectangle's boundary replaced by 8, and interior remains 1? Let's check: Output row2 col2 is 1 (boundary). Output row2 col3-7 are 8. Row3 col2 is 8 (but should be boundary). Wait row3 col2 is 8, but row3 col3-7 are 8. So row3 col2 changed to 8, not 1. So boundary changed.\n\nLet's check right rectangle: Input row3 col19 is 1, output row3 col19 is 1. Wait output row3 col19 is 1. So boundary on right side preserved. But left side boundary changed. Maybe because of some adjacency? Let's examine shape orientation: The left rectangle is vertical? Actually left rectangle is at columns2-8. Right rectangle at columns19-26. Both same shape. Why would left boundary change but right not? Let's inspect output for right rectangle: Row2 col19 is 1? Output row2 col19 is 1. Row3 col19 is 1. Row4 col19 is 1. Row5 col19 is 1. Row3 col26 is 1. So right rectangle boundary remains 1. So left rectangle boundary changed? But output row3 col2 changed to 8. But row2 col2 remains 1. So maybe the left rectangle had some other shape? Wait maybe there is a vertical line connecting left and right rectangles? Let's inspect input rows 1-5 columns2-8 and 19-26. Are there any connections between them? No.\n\nLet's examine output row3 col2: 8. That might be part of a vertical line of 8's drawn from top row? Let's check row1 col15 had 8. Row2 col15? Output row2 col15 is 0? Actually row2 col15 is 0. Row3 col15 is 8. Row4 col15 is 0. Row5 col15 is 0. So 8 at row3 col15. So 8's appear in some pattern maybe a cross shape.\n\nMaybe the rule is to fill the interior of each shape with 8, but also to fill the interior of holes in the shapes? Wait the shapes might have holes (like donut). The interior is defined by 1's forming a loop; interior cells replaced with 8. For left rectangle, interior is rows2-4 columns3-7. In output, those are 8. But boundary cells remained 1 except at row3 col2 changed to 8. That seems like a mistake.\n\nLet's check the output row3 col2 again: In output row3 string: \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0\". So indices: 0:8,1:8,2:8,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:1. So yes col2=8. So left boundary changed.\n\nBut maybe the left rectangle is actually part of a larger shape that includes column0-7? Let's examine input rows around left rectangle: Row0 had zeros. Row1 has 1s at columns2-8. Row2 has 1 at columns2 and 8. Row3 has 1 at column8. Row4 same as row2. Row5 has 1s at columns2-8. So left rectangle is not closed at left side? Actually left side at column2 has 1's at rows1-5. Right side at column8 has 1's at rows1-5. So rectangle is closed. So why boundary changed? Let's check row3 col2 is 1 in input. So output changed to 8. That indicates maybe the rule is to fill the interior and also replace one boundary cell (the left side interior?) with 8 to create a cross shape inside? But why only that one cell? Let's check other boundaries: row3 col8 remains 1. row2 col2 remains 1. row4 col2 remains 1. So only row3 col2 changed. That is the middle of left side. So maybe the rule is to fill the interior and also add 8 at the center of each side of the rectangle? But then we would expect row3 col8 to also change to 8? But it didn't. So maybe because the right rectangle has a vertical line connecting to something else? Let's inspect: In input, there is a vertical line of 1's at column? Actually there's a vertical line at column? Let's check row1-5 columns? There's also a vertical line at column? Wait there is a vertical line at column? The input has a vertical line of 1s at column? Let's look at row1-5 columns? Actually there is a vertical line at column? Not.\n\nLet's look at row1: columns19-26 1s. Row2: columns19 and 26 1s. Row3: column19 1. Row4: same as row2. Row5: columns19-26 1s. So right rectangle closed.\n\nSo why left boundary changed? Maybe because there is a horizontal line of 8's connecting left rectangle to something else? Actually output row3 col15 is 8. That might be connecting left rectangle to right rectangle? Let's see: left rectangle's right side is at col8. Right rectangle's left side at col19. There's a gap of columns9-18. Output row3 col15 is 8, but no 8's elsewhere. So maybe the rule is to draw a line of 8's connecting the two rectangles at the middle row? But only one cell.\n\nWait maybe the output shows 8's filling the interior of each shape, and also 8's at the center of each shape. The center of left rectangle is at row3 col5 (center of rows1-5, columns2-8). Output row3 col5 is 8. Indeed row3 col5 is 8. Similarly center of right rectangle at row3 col22? Output row3 col22 is 8. Yes. So 8's at center of each rectangle. But then why row3 col2 changed? That might be part of interior fill? Let's check: The interior of left rectangle includes columns3-7. So col2 is not interior. So why changed? Maybe it's part of a line connecting center to left side? Let's examine output row3 col2 is 8. That is left boundary but not interior. But maybe the rule is to fill the entire rectangle with 8, except keep the boundary 1's? But that would mean left boundary remains 1. But it's 8. So maybe the rule is to fill entire rectangle with 8, but keep some 1's at the corners? But corners are at row1 col2, row1 col8, row5 col2, row5 col8. Those remain 1. But interior cells become 8. That would mean row3 col2 (boundary) should remain 1, but it's 8. So contradiction.\n\nLet's inspect the shape again: maybe the shape is not a rectangle but a \"U\" shape? Actually left rectangle might have missing boundary at row3 col2? But input row3 col2 is 0? Wait check input row3: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Wait I misread. Let's re-evaluate input row3: The line is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So row3 col8 is 1, row3 col19 is 1. There is no 1 at col2. So left rectangle's left boundary at row3 col2 is 0. So the left rectangle is not closed vertically? Wait earlier we saw row2 col2 = 1, row4 col2 = 1. But row3 col2 is 0. So the left rectangle has a missing cell at row3 col2. So it's like a shape with a hole? Actually it's a rectangle with a missing side cell at the middle. So the shape is not a perfect rectangle; it's like a \"C\" shape? Let's examine: rows1-5 columns2-8: row1: 1s at 2-8. row2: 1 at 2 and 8. row3: 0 at 2, 1 at 8. row4: 1 at 2 and 8. row5: 1s at 2-8. So the shape is a rectangle with a missing left side at row3 col2. So interior includes row3 col3-7? Actually row3 col3-7 are 0. So interior includes row3 col3-7? Yes. So interior cells: rows2-4, cols3-7. Row3 col3-7 are 0. So interior is 3x5 rectangle. So interior fill with 8: row2 col3-7 8, row3 col3-7 8, row4 col3-7 8. That matches output: row2 col3-7 8, row3 col3-7 8, row4 col3-7 8. Good. So left rectangle interior filled with 8. Boundary remains 1 except at missing left cell at row3 col2 (was 0). So output row3 col2 remains 0? But output shows 8 at row3 col2. Wait but input row3 col2 was 0, output row3 col2 is 8. So the missing boundary cell got filled with 8. So the rule: fill interior and also fill any missing boundary cells that are 0? That would fill the hole at row3 col2. So interior + holes fill with 8. So basically fill the entire shape (the region bounded by 1s) with 8, except preserve 1s. But the shape has a missing boundary cell, so that region is not closed, but maybe the shape is considered a closed shape anyway because the boundary is continuous except that missing cell is part of interior? Actually the missing boundary cell is at the left side, but the shape still encloses interior? Let's think: The shape might be considered as a closed shape because the boundary forms a loop but with a missing cell, but maybe the shape is still considered as a closed loop if we consider 4-neighbor connectivity? The missing cell might break the loop. But the algorithm might consider the shape as a \"hole\" region inside the shape that includes that missing cell. So fill all cells that are 0 and are inside the shape's boundary (including holes). That would fill row3 col2. Good.\n\nThus rule: For each shape formed by 1s, fill all cells that are 0 and are surrounded by 1s (i.e., inside the shape) with 8. Keep the 1s unchanged.\n\nNow check right rectangle: Does it have missing boundary? Let's check input right rectangle: row1 col19-26 1s. row2 col19 and 26 1s. row3 col19 1, row4 same as row2, row5 col19-26 1s. So missing boundary at row3 col26? Actually row3 col26 is 0? Wait row3 col26: input row3 has 0 at col26. So missing right side at row3 col26. So interior includes row3 col20-25? Wait interior includes rows2-4, cols20-25. Row3 col20-25 are 0. So interior fill with 8. Also missing boundary at row3 col26 becomes 8. Output row3 col26 is 1? Let's check output row3: after col22? Wait output row3 col26? The row string: \"... 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0\". Actually let's index: row3: 0-27. We have 8 at col0-7, 1 at col8, 0 at col9-14, 0 at col15, 0 at col16-18, 1 at col19, 8 at col20-25, 1 at col26, 0 at col27. So row3 col26 remains 1. So missing boundary at col26 remains 1? But input col26 was 0. Wait input row3 col26 is 0. Output row3 col26 is 1. So the missing boundary cell at row3 col26 is turned into 1? That seems like adding a 1 at that location. But rule was to fill interior with 8. But here we see a 1. So maybe the shape is not missing that boundary; maybe the shape's boundary includes that cell due to 1 at row4 col26? Wait input row4 col26 is 1? Row4: \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\". So row4 col26 is 1. So the right rectangle has a vertical line at column26 from row1-5? Let's check: row1 col26 is 1, row2 col26 is 1, row3 col26 is 0, row4 col26 is 1, row5 col26 is 1. So missing cell at row3 col26. So shape has a hole at that cell. So interior includes row3 col20-25. That cell is filled with 8. But missing boundary at row3 col26 remains 0? But output shows 1. So maybe the rule also adds 1s at missing boundary cells? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLet's examine output row3 col26: it's 1. That is a 1 added where input had 0. So maybe the rule is to fill interior with 8 and also fill missing boundary cells with 1? But why only for right rectangle? Let's check left rectangle: missing boundary at row3 col2 changed to 8, not 1. So inconsistent.\n\nLet's analyze more carefully: Maybe we mis-read output row3 col26. Let's recalc: Output row3: \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0\". Count: indices: 0-7:8, 8:1, 9-14:0, 15:8? Wait 15 is 8? Actually at index 15 it's 8? Let's index: 0:8,1:8,2:8,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:1,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:8,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:1,20:8,21:8,22:8,23:8,24:8,25:8,26:1,27:0. Yes row3 col15 is 8, col26 is 1. So missing boundary at col26 changed to 1. So rule: fill interior with 8; fill missing boundary cells with 1? But left rectangle missing boundary at col2 changed to 8, not 1. So maybe the missing boundary cell at col2 is inside interior? Wait interior includes col3-7 only. So col2 is boundary, not interior. So maybe the rule is to fill interior with 8, and also fill any 0 cells that are directly adjacent to interior? No.\n\nLet's examine the left rectangle missing boundary at col2. That cell is adjacent to interior cells at row3 col3-7. So maybe the rule is to fill interior with 8, and then also fill any 0 cells that are adjacent to interior cells? That would fill col2 and col8? But col8 is boundary with 1, so no. But col2 is adjacent to interior cells horizontally. So it would become 8. That matches left rectangle. For right rectangle, missing boundary at col26 is adjacent to interior cells at row3 col25. So it would also become 8. But output shows 1. So not matching.\n\nMaybe the rule is: fill interior with 8, and also add 1s at missing boundary cells that are at the far right of the shape? But left rectangle missing boundary at col2 is left side, not right. So no.\n\nLet's analyze the output for right rectangle: row3 col26 is 1. But input row3 col26 was 0. So maybe there was a 1 at row3 col26 in input? Let's re-check input row3: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Yes row3 col26 is 0. So output changed to 1. So rule must include adding 1 at missing boundary cells that are at the right side? But left rectangle missing boundary at col2 is left side, not right side. So rule could be: fill interior with 8; add 1 at missing boundary cells that are at the right side of the shape; add 8 at missing boundary cells that are at the left side? That seems arbitrary.\n\nLet's examine other shapes. There are also vertical bars of 1's in input: e.g., at columns? There is a vertical line at column? Let's inspect the input further: After row5, there is a block of zeros until row7: row7 has \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So there is a shape at columns12-14 and 16-20? Actually columns12-14 are 1s, columns16-20 are 1s. So two separate shapes. In output row7, we see \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So interior of shape at columns12-14? Actually shape at columns12-14 is a horizontal bar of 1s. But no interior. But there is a shape at columns16-20 which is a horizontal bar. But output shows 8 at column15? Wait output row7 col15 is 8. That's between the two bars. So 8 appears between two horizontal bars. That suggests maybe a shape connecting them? Let's examine the input: row7 has 1s at columns12-14, then 0 at column15, then 1s at 16-20. So there's a gap of 1 cell between two horizontal bars. In output, that gap becomes 8. So maybe the rule is to fill gaps between adjacent shapes of 1s with 8? But only when the gap is 1 cell? Let's check other rows: row8: input has 1s at columns12 and 20. Output row8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So no 8. So the gap at column15 was only in row7, not others. So 8 only appears there.\n\nLet's examine vertical line at column? In input rows 8-11: there is a vertical line at column? Row8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1 at col12 and col20. Row9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\". So 1 at col6-13, 1 at col16, 1 at col24. Row10: similar. So shapes are more complex.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe the rule is simpler: For each shape of 1s, fill all zeros that are connected to the outside with 0? No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace all zeros that are completely surrounded by 1s (i.e., 4-connected) with 8. That would fill interior holes. That seems plausible. Let's test with left rectangle: The missing boundary at row3 col2 is not surrounded by 1s; it has 1s at row2 col2 and row4 col2, but not left or right. But it's adjacent to interior cells at row3 col3-7 which are 0. So it's not fully surrounded by 1s. So it wouldn't be replaced. But output shows 8 at row3 col2, so that rule fails.\n\nMaybe the rule is to fill all zeros that are within the bounding box of the shape (i.e., inside min/max rows and columns) with 8. That would fill the entire rectangle area, including boundary. But output keeps some 1s. But maybe 1s remain as 1s, others become 8. That matches: interior and missing boundary cells become 8, boundary 1s remain 1. That would fill left rectangle: bounding box rows1-5, cols2-8. Inside that bounding box, cells that are 0 become 8. That includes row3 col2 (0) becomes 8. Row3 col3-7 become 8. Row2 col3-7 become 8. Row4 col3-7 become 8. Row1 col2-8 remain 1. Row5 col2-8 remain 1. So output matches. For right rectangle, bounding box rows1-5, cols19-26. Inside that bounding box, zeros become 8. That includes row3 col20-25 become 8. Row3 col26 is 0 but inside bounding box, so should become 8. But output shows 1 at col26. Wait maybe bounding box is defined as min/max of 1s, but since col26 is a 1 at row2,4,5 but not at row3, the bounding box still includes col26. So inside bounding box, row3 col26 should become 8. But output shows 1. So maybe the rule is to fill zeros that are inside the shape but not on the boundary of the bounding box? But row3 col26 is on the boundary of bounding box (rightmost column). So maybe boundary cells that are 1 remain 1, but zeros on boundary become 0? But output changed it to 1, not 0. So maybe the rule is to fill zeros inside shape but also fill zeros on boundary that are not 1 with 1? That would change row3 col26 to 1. But why not change left rectangle boundary zeros? left rectangle had zero at row3 col2, which is boundary. It became 8, not 1. So not consistent.\n\nLet's examine left rectangle bounding box: min row1, max row5, min col2, max col8. Inside bounding box zeros at row3 col2,3-7. Row3 col2 is boundary, becomes 8. So rule not boundary-specific.\n\nMaybe the difference is that right rectangle has a missing boundary at row3 col26 but also has a 1 at row4 col26, so the shape is \"thick\" at that side. Maybe the rule is to fill zeros that are inside the shape and not adjacent to a 1 on the outside? But row3 col26 is adjacent to 1 at row4 col26 (inside shape) and 1 at row2 col26 (inside shape). But also adjacent to 0 outside? Actually outside to the right is 0. So it's adjacent to outside. But left rectangle missing boundary at row3 col2 is adjacent to 0 on left outside. So both are similar.\n\nMaybe the output row3 col26 is actually 8, but we mis-read due to formatting? Let's double-check output row3: \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0\". That shows col26=1. So indeed 1.\n\nLet's examine input row3 col26: 0. So output changed to 1. So rule must add 1 at that location. Why? Maybe because that cell is part of a shape of 1s that extends vertically? Let's check shape that includes that cell: There's a vertical line of 1s at column26 at rows1,2,4,5. So there is a shape that is like a vertical line with a missing cell at row3 col26. The shape is a vertical line of 1s at column26 except missing at row3. In output, that missing cell becomes 1. So rule: for vertical lines of 1s that are 5 cells long with one missing cell in the middle, fill the missing cell with 1. Similarly, left rectangle missing boundary at row3 col2 is part of a vertical line of 1s at column2 rows1-5 except missing at row3. But that vertical line is part of the rectangle, not a separate shape. But maybe the rule: for any vertical line of 1s that has a missing cell, fill it with 1. But left rectangle missing cell at row3 col2 is part of that vertical line, but it's filled with 8, not 1. So not.\n\nMaybe the missing cell at row3 col26 is part of a vertical line that also has a horizontal line at row3? Wait row3 col26 is adjacent to row3 col25 which is part of horizontal line of 8? But row3 col25 is 8. So the missing cell is adjacent to 8. Maybe rule: if a missing boundary cell is adjacent to interior 8, fill it with 1? But left rectangle missing cell at row3 col2 is adjacent to interior 8 at row3 col3, but it became 8. So no.\n\nLet's examine other shapes: In example 1, there are also vertical lines at column? For example, columns? There's a vertical line of 1s at column? Actually at column? Let's scan: In input, there is a vertical line at column? There's a vertical line at column? The input has many 1s forming shapes. Hard.\n\nMaybe we should analyze example 2 to find a simpler pattern. Example 2 input: There is a shape: a 7x7 block of 1s at top left? Let's analyze: Input row1: \"0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\". So row1 has 1s at columns1-6, and columns15-22. So two blocks. Row2: \"0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\". So 1s at col1,6,15,22. Row3: same pattern. Row4: same. Row5: \"0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\". So row5 has 1s at col1,6,15-22. So left block: rectangle rows1-5, cols1-6. Right block: rectangle rows1-5, cols15-22. They are similar to example1 shapes. In output, the interior of these shapes is filled with 8, and the boundary remains 1. Let's check output row3: \"0 1 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0\". That matches: left block interior rows2-4, cols2-5 become 8. Right block interior rows2-4, cols16-21 become 8. Good. So rule: fill interior with 8.\n\nNow, there are also other shapes: In input, there is a vertical line of 1s at column? Let's examine row6: \"0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". That is a horizontal line at row6, columns1-6. In output, row6 remains same? Output row6: \"0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So horizontal line remains unchanged. So only rectangles are filled.\n\nThen there is a vertical line of 1s at column? Let's check rows7-14: There is a vertical line at column? Row7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So nothing. Row8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So horizontal line at row8, cols10-16. Row9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So vertical line at col10, and col16? Actually row9 col10=1, col16=1. Row10: same. Row11: same. Row12: same. Row13: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So horizontal line at row13, cols10-16. So there's a rectangle of 1s at rows8-13, cols10-16? Let's check: rows8 and 13 have horizontal lines covering cols10-16. Rows9-12 have vertical lines at col10 and col16. So rectangle rows8-13, cols10-16. That's a 6x7 rectangle. In output, this rectangle interior should be filled with 8. Let's check output: Row9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". That matches: interior columns11-15 become 8. Row10 same. Row11 same. Row12 same. Row13 row13 remains horizontal line. Row8 remains horizontal line. Good. So rule: fill interior of rectangles of 1s with 8.\n\nAdditionally, there is a vertical line of 1s at column? Let's check rows15-18: There is a vertical line at column? Row15: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". That's horizontal line at row15, cols2-9. Row16: \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So vertical lines at col2 and col9? Actually row16 col2=1, col9=1, col16-21=1. Row17: same. Row18: same. Row19: same. Row20: same. Row21: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So horizontal line at row21, cols2-4 and 6-9? Wait row21 has 1s at col2,3,4,6,7,8,9. So shape of 1s at rows15-21, cols2-9? But row21 has missing col5. So shape is rectangle with a missing cell at row21 col5. So interior of that rectangle (rows16-20, cols3-8) should be filled with 8. Let's check output: Row16: \"0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". That shows interior columns3-8 are 8. Row17 same. Row18 same. Row19 same. Row20 same. Row21: \"0 0 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So row21 col5 becomes 8. That matches: missing boundary cell becomes 8. Good. So rule: fill interior of rectangles, and fill any missing boundary cells that are inside the bounding box? Actually row21 col5 is missing boundary cell (since rectangle boundary includes col5). It becomes 8. So rule: fill all zeros inside bounding box of rectangle with 8. That includes missing boundary cells.\n\nThus rule: For each rectangular shape of 1s (i.e., shape that is an axis-aligned rectangle of 1s, maybe with holes), fill all zeros inside the bounding box of the shape with 8. Keep 1s as is. That seems to hold for example 2.\n\nNow check example 1: Does the left shape have bounding box rows1-5, cols2-8. All zeros inside become 8: yes. That includes row3 col2. Good. For right shape: bounding box rows1-5, cols19-26. All zeros inside become 8: row3 col20-25 become 8; row3 col26? Wait bounding box includes col26. So row3 col26 is zero inside bounding box, should become 8. But output shows 1. So maybe we mis-identified bounding box: maybe the right shape bounding box is rows1-5, cols19-25? Because maybe col26 is not part of shape because the shape is not closed? But there are 1s at col26 rows1,2,4,5, so bounding box includes col26. But maybe the shape is considered to have width 7? Let's examine: In input, right shape at row1: columns19-26 inclusive: 8 cells. At row2: columns19 and 26. At row3: column19 only. At row4: columns19 and 26. At row5: columns19-26. So bounding box is rows1-5, cols19-26. So inside bounding box, zeros at row3 col20-25, row3 col26? Actually row3 col26 is 0. So it should become 8. But output shows 1. So maybe the rule is not bounding box but interior of shape defined by 1s as a closed loop. The missing boundary at row3 col26 is not considered interior because the shape is not closed? But the shape is closed? Let's check: The shape's boundary: top row1 col19-26; bottom row5 col19-26; left column col19 rows1-5; right column col26 rows1-5. But row3 col26 is missing, so the right boundary is not continuous. So shape is not closed, so interior is not well-defined. So maybe the interior is defined by the closed loops of 1s. The shape is not closed, so interior is not considered. But then why left shape had missing boundary at row3 col2 but still interior? Because left shape had missing boundary at row3 col2 but still had interior. But left shape also had missing boundary at row3 col2, so shape not closed. But interior defined as region of zeros that is surrounded by 1s in all directions? That would exclude row3 col2 because it's adjacent to outside on left side. But interior includes row3 col2? Wait interior is zeros that are surrounded by 1s in all four directions? Let's test: row3 col2 has neighbors: up row2 col2=1, down row4 col2=1, left row3 col1=0, right row3 col3=0. So not surrounded. So interior would not include row3 col2. But output includes 8 at row3 col2. So interior defined differently.\n\nThus the rule is likely bounding box fill. But why right shape didn't fill row3 col26? Let's check output again: maybe row3 col26 is 0? Let's double-check the output row3 string: \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0\". Wait we mis-read: The string shows \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\" then \"1\" at index 8, then zeros until index 15, then \"8\" at index 15, then zeros until index 19, then \"1\" at index 19, then \"8 8 8 8 8 8\" from index 20-25, then \"1\" at index 26, then \"0\". So col26 is 1. So row3 col26 is 1. So output changed 0 to 1. But maybe the rule is: fill interior zeros with 8, but if a zero is adjacent to the boundary of the rectangle on the right side, fill with 1? That seems odd.\n\nWait maybe we mis-evaluated the shape: maybe the shape at right side is not a rectangle but two separate shapes: one at columns19-25 and one at column26? Let's examine input: row1 has 1s at 19-26. Row2 has 1 at 19 and 26. Row3 has 1 at 19 only. Row4 has 1 at 19 and 26. Row5 has 1s at 19-26. So shape includes column26 at rows1,2,4,5. So shape is not continuous at row3. But maybe the shape is considered two separate shapes: one shape at columns19-25 (with missing column26), and one shape at column26 (vertical line). The vertical line at column26 is a separate shape. In output, vertical line at column26: row1,2,4,5 remain 1, row3 becomes 1? Wait output row3 col26 is 1. So vertical line shape had missing cell at row3, which became 1. That matches rule: fill missing cells in vertical line shape? But vertical line shape is not rectangular; it's a vertical line. But rule might be: for any shape of 1s that is not rectangular, fill missing cells inside the bounding box? But vertical line shape bounding box rows1-5, col26-26. Inside bounding box zeros: row3 col26. Fill with 8? But output shows 1. So maybe vertical line shape is considered \"line\" shape, and missing cells are filled with 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: For each shape of 1s that forms a rectangle, fill interior zeros with 8. For each shape of 1s that is not a rectangle, fill missing cells with 1. That could explain: left rectangle had missing cell at row3 col2, but that shape is rectangle with missing boundary cell, but still considered rectangle? Actually shape is not rectangle because missing cell breaks boundary. But maybe they still consider it rectangle because the bounding box of 1s is rectangle. So they fill missing boundary cells with 8. For vertical line shape at column26, bounding box is single column, shape is rectangle too. But missing cell at row3 col26 is inside bounding box, so should be filled with 8. But output shows 1. So maybe vertical line shape is considered a line, not rectangle, so missing cells filled with 1. But left shape is rectangle, so missing boundary cell filled with 8. That seems plausible.\n\nBut why vertical line shape at column26? It is 4 cells tall, 1 column wide. That is rectangle too. But maybe because it's width 1, they treat it as line. But left shape width 7, so rectangle.\n\nThus rule: For each rectangular shape of 1s (width>1), fill interior zeros with 8. For each line shape (width=1 or height=1?), fill missing cells with 1? But vertical line shape width=1, height=5, missing cell at row3. They fill with 1. For horizontal line shapes, they remain unchanged. In example 2, horizontal lines remained unchanged. Vertical line shapes? There is a vertical line at column? In example 2, there is a vertical line at column? Let's check: row? There's a vertical line at column? Actually at column? There is a vertical line at column? For example, the shape at rows15-21, cols2-9: it's rectangle width 8, height 7. So rectangle. So interior filled with 8, missing boundary at row21 col5 becomes 8. Good.\n\nThus rule seems consistent: For rectangular shapes of 1s (with width>1 and height>1), fill interior zeros with 8. For line shapes (either width=1 or height=1), leave unchanged? But vertical line at column26 was width=1, height=5. In example 2, there is a vertical line at column? Let's check: In example 2, there is a vertical line at column? For example, at rows? There's a vertical line at column? Let's search: In input, after row13, there is a vertical line at column? Actually at row? Let's look at row15: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So horizontal line. Then vertical line at columns? At row16: \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So vertical lines at col2 and col9 and col16-21. Those vertical lines are width=1. They are part of rectangle shape at rows15-21, cols2-9. So vertical lines are part of rectangle. So no separate vertical line shapes.\n\nThus only vertical line shape in example 1 is at column26, which is separate. So rule: fill interior zeros of rectangles with 8, leave other shapes unchanged (except maybe fill missing cells of line shapes with 1?). But left shape missing cell is interior of rectangle, so filled with 8.\n\nThus for test input, we need to identify all rectangular shapes of 1s (width>1, height>1) and fill interior zeros with 8. Also maybe fill missing boundary cells of rectangles with 8 as well. Let's apply to test input.\n\nTest Input grid 26x28? Let's count columns: each row has 28 numbers? Let's check first row: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" That's 26 numbers? Wait count: I'll count: 0's separated by spaces. The line shows 26 zeros? Actually we need to count: there are 26 zeros? Let's quickly count: \"0\" repeated? Let's count manually: 1-26? It's 26? Wait we can approximate: The grid seems 26 columns. But earlier examples had 28 columns. But test input seems 26 columns? Let's count row3: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". That's 26 numbers. So grid is 26 columns. Rows: count number of rows: there are 26 rows? Let's count lines: from \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" repeated 3 times? Let's count: Provided test input lines: starting after \"Test Input:\" there are many lines. Let's count them: I will list with numbers:\n\n1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n5: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n6: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n7: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n8: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n15: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n16: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n17: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n18: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n19: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n20: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0\n21: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n22: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n23: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n24: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n25: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n26: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo 26 rows, 26 columns.\n\nNow we need to find rectangular shapes of 1s. Let's find all contiguous blocks of 1s that form rectangles.\n\nObservations: There is a large shape at top left: rows3-8? Let's examine rows3-8 columns2-? Let's analyze cluster of 1s.\n\nRow3: columns2-10? Actually row3: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 ...\" So row3 has 1s at columns2-10 (indices 2-10 inclusive). So that's 9 cells. Row4: \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ... 1 ... 1 0\"? Actually row4: \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\". So row4 has 1s at columns2,10,16,24? Wait let's index: columns: 0-25. Row4 col2=1, col10=1, col16=1, col24=1. So row4 has 1s at columns2,10,16,24.\n\nRow5: same as row4: 1 at columns2,10,16,24.\n\nRow6: same: 1 at columns2,10,16,24.\n\nRow7: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 ... 1 0 ... 1 0\". Row7 has 1s at columns2-10, and at column16, and at column24. Actually row7 col16=1, col24=1.\n\nRow8: row8 has \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\". So 1 at col16 and col24.\n\nRow9: row9 has \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\". So 1s at columns6-13, and at column16, and at column24.\n\nRow10: row10: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\". So 1s at col6, col13, col16-24.\n\nRow11: row11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1 at col13.\n\nRow12: row12: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1 at col6 and col13.\n\nRow13: row13: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So 1 at col6, col13, col16-22.\n\nRow14: row14: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\". So 1 at col6-13, col16, col22.\n\nRow15: row15: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\". So 1 at col16 and col22.\n\nRow16: row16: same as row15.\n\nRow17: row17: same as row15.\n\nRow18: row18: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\". So 1 at col3-10, col16, col22.\n\nRow19: row19: \"0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\". So 1 at col3, col10, col16, col22.\n\nRow20: row20: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0\". So 1 at col10, col16-19, col21-22? Actually col21? Wait index: col0-25. Row20 col10=1, col16-19=1, col21-22=1? Wait row20 col21? Actually row20 has \"... 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0\". Let's index: row20: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0. So 1 at col10, col16-19, col21-22. So 1 at col21,22.\n\nRow21: row21: \"0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1 at col3, col10.\n\nRow22: row22: same as row21.\n\nRow23: row23: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1 at col3-10, col14-18.\n\nRow24: row24: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1 at col14, col18.\n\nRow25: row25: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1 at col14, col15, col17-18.\n\nRow26: all zeros.\n\nSo we have many shapes. Let's identify rectangular shapes:\n\n1. Top-left shape: rows3-8, cols2-10. Row3 has 1s at 2-10. Row4-6 have 1s at 2 and 10. Row7 has 1s at 2-10. Row8 has 1s at 2-10? Actually row8 has 1s at 2-10? Wait row8: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 ...\" Yes row8 col2-10 are 1. So shape rows3-8, cols2-10 is a rectangle with 1s on boundary and zeros inside at rows4-6, cols3-9. So interior zeros should be filled with 8. That matches example rule. So output should have 8 at rows4-6, cols3-9.\n\nAlso there is shape at rows3-8, cols16? Actually there is a column of 1s at col16 from rows3-8? Let's check: row3 col16=0? Wait row3 col16 is 0. Row4 col16=1. Row5 col16=1. Row6 col16=1. Row7 col16=1. Row8 col16=1. So column of 1s at col16 from rows4-8. But also there is shape at col24? Column 24 has 1s at rows3-8? Row3 col24=0? Actually row3 col24=0. Row4 col24=1. Row5 col24=1. Row6 col24=1. Row7 col24=1. Row8 col24=1. So vertical line at col24 rows4-8. But maybe these are part of larger rectangle: rows3-8, cols16-24? Let's examine: row3 has 1s at col16? No. Row3 col16=0. So shape at col16-24 is not rectangular.\n\nThus we have rectangular shapes: shape A: rows3-8, cols2-10.\n\nShape B: maybe rows3-8, cols16-24? But row3 has 0 at 16, but shape might be rectangle with missing top boundary at row3? Let's examine shape at rows3-8, cols16-24: Row3: 0 at 16-24 except maybe some? Actually row3 has 0 at 16-24. Row4: 1 at 16,24. Row5: 1 at 16,24. Row6: 1 at 16,24. Row7: 1 at 16,24. Row8: 1 at 16,24. So shape is like a vertical line pair at col16 and col24, but no interior. So not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows3-8, col? There's also shape at rows3-8, col? Actually there is shape at rows3-8, col? Wait there is shape at rows3-8, col? Let's examine cluster of 1s at columns? There's also shape at rows3-8, col? Actually there is shape at rows3-8, col? The vertical lines at col16 and col24 are part of shape at rows3-8, but they might belong to a rectangle with other 1s? Let's examine cluster at rows3-8, cols16-24: row3 has no 1s, but maybe there is shape at rows3-8, cols? Actually there is a rectangle at rows3-8, cols16-24? But top row has no 1s, so not rectangle.\n\nThus shape A is the only rectangle in top left.\n\nNext shape: rows9-10? Let's examine cluster of 1s at rows9-10, cols6-13. Row9 has 1s at 6-13. Row10 has 1 at 6, and 13? Wait row10 col13=1. So shape rows9-10, cols6-13: top row9 has 1s at 6-13. Row10 has 1 at 6 and 13. So shape is rectangle with missing interior? But interior would be rows10? Actually shape height 2 rows, width 8 columns. But interior would be zero cells at row10, cols7-12. Those are 0. So fill them with 8. But row10 has 1 at col13, so shape boundaries: top row9 6-13, bottom row10 6-13. So shape is rectangle with interior at row10, cols7-12. So fill with 8. But we need to check if there are other shapes overlapping.\n\nAlso shape at rows9-10, col16-24: Row9 col16=1, col24=1. Row10 col16-24 are 1s. So shape rows9-10, cols16-24: top row9 has 1 at 16 and 24, bottom row10 has 1 at 16-24. So shape rectangle width 9 columns? Actually width 9: cols16-24 inclusive. Top row has 1 at 16 and 24 only, interior zeros at 17-23. Bottom row has 1 at 16-24. So interior: row9 cols17-23, row10? Wait shape height 2: rows9-10. So interior at row10? Actually interior cells are those not on boundary: For height 2, interior is none? Because top and bottom rows are boundary. So shape has no interior. So no fill.\n\nBut shape at rows9-10, col? There is also shape at row9-10, col? Actually row9 has 1 at col6-13 and 16 and 24. Row10 has 1 at col6,13,16-24. So shape at rows9-10, col6-13 is rectangle with interior at row10 cols7-12. That interior should be filled with 8. So output row10 col7-12 should be 8. But we need to check if row10 col7-12 are zeros. Row10 col7=0, col8=0, col9=0, col10=0, col11=0, col12=0. Yes. So fill them with 8.\n\nAlso shape at rows9-10, col? There's also shape at rows9-10, col? Actually row9 has 1 at 16 and 24 only. So shape at col16-24 is not rectangle because top row missing many cells. So ignore.\n\nNext shape: rows11-13, col13? Let's examine cluster at rows11-13, col13: Row11 col13=1. Row12 col13=1. Row13 col13=1. So vertical line at col13 rows11-13. Height 3. Not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows11-13, col6? Row11 col6=0? Actually row11 col6=0. Row12 col6=1. Row13 col6=1. So vertical line at col6 rows12-13. Height 2. Not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows11-13, col16-22: Row11 col16-22: 1 at 16, and 21-22? Wait row11 col16=1, col21=1, col22=1. Row12 col16=1, col21=1, col22=1. Row13 col16-22 all 1. So shape rows11-13, cols16-22: top row11 has 1 at 16,21,22. Bottom row13 has 1 at 16-22. Middle row12 has 1 at 16,21,22. So shape is rectangle with interior at row12 cols17-20? Wait interior: rows12 col17-20 zeros. Yes. So fill row12 col17-20 with 8.\n\nAlso shape at rows11-13, col? There's also shape at rows11-13, col? Actually row11 has 1 at col16,21,22. Row12 has 1 at col16,21,22. Row13 has 1 at col16-22. So shape is rectangle 3 rows tall, 7 columns wide. So interior: row12 cols17-20. Yes.\n\nNext shape: rows14-15? Let's examine cluster at rows14-15, col6-13: Row14 has 1s at 6-13. Row15 has 1 at 13. So shape rows14-15, cols6-13: top row14 6-13, bottom row15 6-13? Actually row15 col6-12 are 0, only col13=1. So shape not rectangle.\n\nBut shape at rows14-15, col16? Row14 col16=1, row15 col16=1. So vertical line.\n\nAlso shape at rows14-15, col22: Row14 col22=1, row15 col22=1. So vertical line.\n\nNext shape: rows14-15, col? Actually row14 has 1 at col6-13, col16, col22. Row15 has 1 at col16, col22. So shape at rows14-15, col16-22? Not rectangle.\n\nNext shape: rows15-17, col16-22: Row15-17 all have 1 at 16 and 22. So vertical line at col16 and col22. But maybe shape at rows15-17, col16-22? Let's check: row15: 1 at 16,22. Row16: 1 at 16,22. Row17: 1 at 16,22. So shape vertical line pair. Not rectangle.\n\nNext shape: rows18-19, col3-10: Row18 has 1 at 3-10. Row19 has 1 at 3 and 10. So shape rows18-19, cols3-10: rectangle with interior at row19 cols4-9? Actually interior: row19 col4-9 zeros. So fill row19 col4-9 with 8.\n\nAlso shape at rows18-19, col16: Row18 col16=1, Row19 col16=1. So vertical line.\n\nShape at rows18-19, col22: Row18 col22=1, Row19 col22=1. So vertical line.\n\nNext shape: rows18-20, col16-19? Actually row18 has 1 at 16, row19 has 1 at 16, row20 has 1 at 16-19. So shape rows18-20, cols16-19: top row18 has 1 at 16 only, bottom row20 has 1 at 16-19, middle row19 has 1 at 16 only. Not rectangle.\n\nShape at rows18-20, col21-22: Row18 col22=1, Row19 col22=1, Row20 col21-22=1. So shape rows18-20, cols21-22: top row18 has 1 at 22, bottom row20 has 1 at 21-22, middle row19 has 1 at 22. So shape rectangle width 2, height 3: interior at row19 col21? Actually interior: row19 col21 is 0. So fill row19 col21 with 8.\n\nNext shape: rows21-22, col3 and col10: vertical line at col3, col10.\n\nNext shape: rows21-23, col3-10: Row21 col3,10; Row22 col3,10; Row23 col3-10. So shape rows21-23, cols3-10: rectangle with interior at rows22 col4-9? Actually interior: row22 col4-9 zeros. So fill row22 col4-9 with 8.\n\nAlso shape at rows21-23, col14-18: Row21 none? Row22 none? Row23 has 1 at 14-18. But no rectangle.\n\nNext shape: rows23-24, col14-18? Row23 has 1 at 14-18, row24 has 1 at 14 and 18. So shape rows23-24, cols14-18: rectangle with interior at row24 col15-17? Actually interior: row24 col15-17 zeros. So fill row24 col15-17 with 8.\n\nAlso shape at rows23-25, col14-18? Row25 has 1 at 14,15,17,18. Row23 has 1 at 14-18. Row24 has 1 at 14,18. So shape rows23-25, cols14-18: rectangle with interior at row24 col15-17? Row24 col15-17 zeros. Row25 col15=1, col17=1. So interior at row24 col15-17. So fill those with 8. Also row24 col14,18 remain 1.\n\nAlso shape at rows23-25, col? Actually row23 has 1 at 14-18. Row24 has 1 at 14 and 18. Row25 has 1 at 14,15,17,18. So shape rows23-25, cols14-18 is rectangle with missing interior? Yes interior at row24 col15-17 zeros. So fill row24 col15-17 with 8. Also row24 col14,18 remain 1.\n\nAlso shape at rows23-25, col? Actually row25 has 1 at 14,15,17,18. So shape at rows23-25, col14-18 is rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows24-25, col17? Row24 col17=0? Actually row24 col17=0. Row25 col17=1. So vertical line at col17 rows25 only. Not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows24-25, col15? Row24 col15=0, row25 col15=1. So vertical line.\n\nAlso shape at rows24-25, col18? Row24 col18=0? Actually row24 col18=0? Wait row24 col18=0? Let's check row24: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So col18=1? Wait index: col0-25. Row24 col18=1? Let's index: 0-25: col0-13 zeros, col14=1, col15=0, col16=0, col17=0, col18=1, col19=0, col20=0, col21=0, col22=0, col23=0, col24=0, col25=0. So row24 has 1 at col14 and col18. So shape at col18 rows24-25: row25 col18=1. So vertical line at col18 rows24-25. So not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows24-25, col14-18 rectangle? Actually row24 col14-18 includes 14,18. Row25 col14-18 includes 14,15,17,18. So rectangle width 5, height 2: top row24 has 1 at 14,18. Bottom row25 has 1 at 14,15,17,18. So shape not rectangle because missing at 16,17? Actually bottom row has 1 at 17, but top row missing 17. So not rectangle.\n\nThus we have identified rectangles:\n\n- A: rows3-8, cols2-10\n- B: rows9-10, cols6-13\n- C: rows11-13, cols16-22\n- D: rows18-19, cols3-10\n- E: rows21-23, cols3-10\n- F: rows23-25, cols14-18\n\nAlso maybe shape at rows14-15, col? Actually row14 col6-13 and row15 col13 only: not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows14-15, col16-22? Row14 col16=1, row15 col16=1, row14 col22=1, row15 col22=1. So vertical line pair, not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows15-17, col? Not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows18-20, col21-22: rectangle width 2, height 3. We considered that as shape G: rows18-20, cols21-22.\n\nAlso shape at rows18-20, col? Actually shape at rows18-20, col? Let's check: row18 col16=1, row19 col16=1, row20 col16=1. So vertical line at col16 rows18-20. Not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows18-20, col? Actually row20 has 1 at col16-19, col21-22. So shape at rows18-20, cols16-19: top row18 col16=1, bottom row20 col16-19=1, middle row19 col16=1. So not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows18-20, col? Actually shape at rows18-20, col? Let's consider rectangle rows18-20, cols16-22? Row18: 1 at 16,22. Row19: 1 at 16,22. Row20: 1 at 16-19,21-22. So shape not rectangle.\n\nThus we have shapes A, B, C, D, E, F, G.\n\nNow apply rule: fill interior zeros of each rectangle with 8.\n\nLet's compute each shape interior:\n\nShape A: rows3-8, cols2-10. Interior rows4-6, cols3-9. So set those to 8.\n\nShape B: rows9-10, cols6-13. Interior: rows10? Actually height 2, so interior rows10? Wait rectangle height 2: rows9-10. For height 2, interior rows are none? Actually interior is cells not on boundary. For a 2-row rectangle, all cells are boundary. So no interior. But we might consider interior as row10 cols7-12? But row10 is bottom row, so boundary. So no interior. But we may fill zeros at row10 cols7-12? But that would be filling bottom row. But rule says fill interior zeros only. So shape B has no interior. So no change.\n\nBut in example 2, shape B had interior rows2-4, cols? For rectangle of height 5, interior rows are 2-4. So interior cells at those rows. For rectangle of height 2, interior rows none. So no change.\n\nShape C: rows11-13, cols16-22. Height 3. Interior rows: row12. Columns interior: 17-20. So set row12 col17-20 to 8.\n\nShape D: rows18-19, cols3-10. Height 2. No interior.\n\nShape E: rows21-23, cols3-10. Height 3. Interior rows: row22. Columns interior: 4-9. So set row22 col4-9 to 8.\n\nShape F: rows23-25, cols14-18. Height 3. Interior rows: row24. Columns interior: 15-17. So set row24 col15-17 to 8.\n\nShape G: rows18-20, cols21-22. Height 3. Interior rows: row19. Columns interior: 22? Wait interior columns: since width 2, columns interior: none? For width 2, no interior columns. So no interior. So shape G has no interior.\n\nAdditionally, shape at rows3-8, cols16-24? Not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows9-10, cols16-24? Not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows14-15, col6-13? Not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows14-15, col16-22? Not rectangle.\n\nAlso shape at rows15-17, col16-22? Not rectangle.\n\nThus we fill interior zeros for shapes A, C, E, F.\n\nAlso check shape at rows18-20, cols21-22: width 2, height 3, interior rows row19, but interior columns none, so no change.\n\nNow we also need to consider any missing boundary cells? In shape A, boundary cells at row3 col2? Row3 col2 is 1. Row4 col2=1. Row5 col2=1. Row6 col2=1. Row7 col2=1. Row8 col2=1. So boundary complete. So no missing boundary. Good.\n\nShape C: boundary cells: top row11 col16-22 all 1. Bottom row13 col16-22 all 1. Left column col16 rows11-13 all 1. Right column col22 rows11-13 all 1. So boundary complete. Good.\n\nShape E: top row21 col3-10 all 1. Bottom row23 col3-10 all 1. Left col3 rows21-23 all 1. Right col10 rows21-23 all 1. Good.\n\nShape F: top row23 col14-18 all 1. Bottom row25 col14-18 all 1. Left col14 rows23-25 all 1. Right col18 rows23-25 all 1. Good.\n\nThus no missing boundary cells.\n\nNow we also need to consider any other shapes that might be rectangles but we missed.\n\nLet's double-check for shape at rows14-15, col6-13? Row14 col6-13 all 1. Row15 col6-13: only col13=1. So shape not rectangle.\n\nShape at rows14-15, col16-22? Row14 col16=1, col22=1. Row15 col16=1, col22=1. So shape width 2, height 2: rectangle? Top row14 col16,22? Actually top row14 has 1 at 16 and 22 only, not continuous. So shape not rectangle.\n\nShape at rows15-17, col16-22? Row15 col16,22. Row16 col16,22. Row17 col16,22. So shape width 2, height 3. But interior columns none. So no interior.\n\nShape at rows18-20, col16-19? Row18 col16=1, row19 col16=1, row20 col16-19=1. So shape width 4, height 3. But top row18 has only col16=1, bottom row20 has 16-19=1, middle row19 has 16=1. So not rectangle.\n\nShape at rows18-20, col21-22: width 2, height 3. Not interior.\n\nShape at rows21-23, col14-18? Row21 no 1s. So not rectangle.\n\nThus we have correct shapes.\n\nNow we need to produce output grid: copy input grid but replace interior zeros of shapes A, C, E, F with 8.\n\nLet's produce output grid row by row.\n\nI'll create a 26x26 grid of zeros initially, then copy 1s from input, then fill 8s.\n\nLet's start with original grid.\n\nI'll represent rows 0-25.\n\nRow0: all zeros. Output row0 remains all zeros.\n\nRow1: all zeros. Output row1 all zeros.\n\nRow2: row2: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So columns 2-10 are 1. Output same.\n\nRow3: row3: \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\". So 1 at col2, col10, col16-18, col20-24? Wait we need to index: Let's index row3:\n\nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:1,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:1,17:1,18:1,19:0,20:1,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:0.\n\nSo 1 at 2,10,16,17,18,20,21,22,23,24.\n\nOutput row3: same 1s, no interior fill (since shape A interior rows4-6). So row3 unchanged.\n\nRow4: row4: \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\". So 1 at 2,10,16,24.\n\nRow5: same as row4.\n\nRow6: same as row4.\n\nRow7: row7: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\".

So 1 at 14,15,17,18.\n\nRow26: all zeros.\n\nNow we fill interior zeros:\n\nShape A: rows4-6, cols3-9 become 8.\n\nSo modify rows4,5,6:\n\nRow4 originally: 1 at col2,10,16,24. So we set col3-9 to 8. So row4 after: col2=1, col3-9=8, col10=1, col11-15 zeros, col16=1, col24=1.\n\nRow5 same: col3-9=8.\n\nRow6 same.\n\nShape C: rows11-13, cols16-22. Interior row12, cols17-20 set to 8.\n\nRow12 originally: 1 at 6,13. So we set col17-20 to 8. So row12: 1 at 6,13, 8 at 17-20, rest zeros.\n\nShape E: rows21-23, cols3-10. Interior row22, cols4-9 set to 8.\n\nRow22 originally: 1 at 3,10. So set col4-9 to 8.\n\nShape F: rows23-25, cols14-18. Interior row24, cols15-17 set to 8.\n\nRow24 originally: 1 at 14,18. Set col15-17 to 8.\n\nAlso check shape G: rows18-20, cols21-22: interior row19 col? width 2, no interior.\n\nAlso shape B: rows9-10, cols6-13: no interior.\n\nNow produce output grid.\n\nLet's produce each row:\n\nRow0: 26 zeros.\n\nRow1: 26 zeros.\n\nRow2: same as input: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow3: same as input: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\nRow4: modify: indices: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:1,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:1,17:0,18:0,19:0,20:0,21:0,22:0,23:0,24:1,25:0.\n\nRow5: same as row4.\n\nRow6: same as row4.\n\nRow7: same as input: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n\nRow8: same as input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n\nRow9: same as input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n\nRow10: same as input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\nRow11: same as input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow12: modify: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait we set col17-20 to 8, but indices: 0-25. So col17=8, col18=8, col19=8, col20=8. Yes. So row12: col6=1, col13=1, col17-20=8, rest 0.\n\nRow13: same as input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\nRow14: same as input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow15: same as input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow16: same as row15.\n\nRow17: same as row15.\n\nRow18: same as input: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow19: same as input: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow20: same as input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0\n\nRow21: same as input: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow22: modify: 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow23: same as input: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow24: modify: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow25: same as input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow26: all zeros.\n\nWait row26 is not present? Actually we have 26 rows, indexed 0-25. Row25 is last. So we have row0-25. Row26 doesn't exist.\n\nThus final output grid.\n\nBut we need to double-check shape A interior: rows4-6, cols3-9. We set those to 8. That matches.\n\nShape C interior: row12, cols17-20 set to 8. Good.\n\nShape E interior: row22, cols4-9 set to 8. Good.\n\nShape F interior: row24, cols15-17 set to 8. Good.\n\nNow check if any other interior cells exist: maybe shape at rows21-23, cols3-10 interior row22, cols4-9 we did. Good.\n\nAlso shape at rows23-25, cols14-18 interior row24, cols15-17 we did.\n\nNow ensure we didn't accidentally set any 1 to 8 incorrectly. For shape A, we set col3-9 to 8. But original row4 col3-9 were 0. Good.\n\nFor shape C, row12 col17-20 were 0. Good.\n\nFor shape E, row22 col4-9 were 0. Good.\n\nFor shape F, row24 col15-17 were 0. Good.\n\nNow we also need to check if any other rectangle shapes exist that we missed: maybe shape at rows14-15, col? Actually row14 col6-13 and row15 col13: not rectangle. But shape at rows14-15, col16-22? Not rectangle. So no.\n\nAlso shape at rows18-20, col21-22? width 2, height 3. No interior.\n\nThus output grid is as above.\n\nLet's format output grid as 26 rows of 26 numbers each.\n\nI'll write them line by line.\n\nRow0: 26 zeros.\n\nRow1: 26 zeros.\n\nRow2: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow3: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\nRow4: 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n\nRow5: same as row4\n\nRow6: same as row4\n\nRow7: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n\nRow10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\nRow11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\nRow14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow15: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow16: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow17: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow18: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow19: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow20: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0\n\nRow21: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow22: 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow23: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow24: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow25: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nCheck row4-6 we repeated same line. Should we keep them identical? Yes.\n\nLet's verify row4: 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. Good.\n\nRow5 same.\n\nRow6 same.\n\nNow confirm row12: we had 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0. Good.\n\nRow22: 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Good.\n\nRow24: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Good.\n\nDouble-check row24: original had 1 at col14 and 18. We set col15-17 to 8. So col14=1, col15=8, col16=8, col17=8, col18=1. Good.\n\nNow verify row24 has 26 columns: indices 0-25. Let's list: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:1,15:8,16:8,17:8,18:1,19:0,20:0,21:0,22:0,23:0,24:0,25:0. Yes.\n\nNow check row25: original had 1 at col14,15,17,18. We didn't change. So row25: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Yes.\n\nCheck row22: original had 1 at col3 and col10. We set col4-9 to 8. So row22: 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Yes.\n\nCheck row4-6: original had 1 at col2,10,16,24. We set col3-9 to 8. So row4: 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. Yes.\n\nNow verify shape A interior row4-6 col3-9 are 8. Good.\n\nNow check shape C interior row12 col17-20 are 8. Yes.\n\nNow check shape E interior row22 col4-9 are 8. Yes.\n\nNow check shape F interior row24 col15-17 are 8. Yes.\n\nNow check if any other interior cells are present: shape at rows18-20, cols21-22 no interior. shape at rows18-20, cols3-10 no interior. shape at rows21-23, cols3-10 interior row22 col4-9 done. shape at rows23-25, cols14-18 interior row24 col15-17 done.\n\nThus output grid is ready.\n\nLet's format final answer with each row as space-separated numbers.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0<|return|>"
