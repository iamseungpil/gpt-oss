We need to analyze given example: Input grid 3x3 with center cell value 1; all others zero. Output grid has ones everywhere except center remains 0? Wait expected output shows [[1,1,??]. Let's check: Provided "expected output" maybe wrong? They say output grid: [[1 ,1 , ?]] Actually they wrote: Expected output grid:[[1, 1, 1],[1,0,1],[...]]. So yes it's a ring of ones around central zero. That seems like transform: fill entire border cells with 1s (or color) while leaving interior unchanged? But there may be other rules: For any non-zero pixel in input, set its orthogonal neighbors to that same value? In this case only one nonzero at center -> set all adjacent cells to 1 as well? But also diagonals become 1 too? The output includes corners which are diagonal from center but not directly orthogonally connected. However if we propagate outward until boundary? Starting from center, flood-fill outwards setting all reachable cells to same value until hitting boundaries? Since whole grid size small, result would be all cells filled with 0 or 1 depending on propagation? If starting from center 1 and spreading to all cells because no obstacles, you'd get all 1's including center. But center stays 0 so that's different.

Maybe rule: Surround each non-zero element with zeros? No.

Let's think: Input has single colored cell 1. Output forms cross shape plus corners? It's basically full matrix of 1 except center 0. That's like invert colors for all cells except those originally equal to something else? Another possibility: Replace every 0 with 5? Not.

Could be rule: Set all cells to maximum of their own value and values of neighboring cells? With center=1, neighbor max =1 => all cells become 0+max(others?) Hmm.

Alternatively could be: Create a halo of 0 around the original object? But here halo is 1 around 0.

Wait maybe rule: Mirror across both axes? Center remains 1? But output center 2? Eh.

Given limited data, simplest explanation: Fill all positions with 8-neighbor average? For center 4? Not match.

But typical ARC tasks: When there's a unique colored point, you create a frame of that color around it. Example: Input: single red dot; output: square of red dots surrounding it. Yes! This matches: We take the position of
