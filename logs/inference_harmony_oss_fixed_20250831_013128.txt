<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to understand what the problem is. The input seems like five numbers separated by spaces? In examples, inputs have length 5 always. Output grids vary in size.

Observations:

Example1 Input: "1  0   7   0    0". So array A = [1,0,7,0 ,0]. Output grid is 10x10 (size?). Let's examine output of Example1: It's symmetrical along main diagonal maybe reversed order? Actually look at first row: "0  1" last element 1? Wait first row has '... 1' at end? Provided:

Row1: 0 0 … 1 (last). Row2 ends with ... 1 at position second-to-last? Let's copy:

Given:

0  | 0 | 1?? Wait let's parse properly.

They show each line as 10 columns. For example, first line: 
`0 00 00 … 01`. Let me rewrite:

Line1: `0 000 001 0? No.

Let's transcribe from text:

```
0  & 0 & 1?
```

Actually they gave lines:

First line: `1 1??? Wait no.`

Let's read carefully:

From prompt:

```

Output:
 0      0     0       0        0          0         0           0            0              1  
0      ...
...
```

But it's messy due formatting. But we can deduce that output appears to place non-zero elements on diagonals shifting leftwards or rightwards gradually forming a path?

Look at Example2: Input `[0,0;2,0]`: Actually input: 5 numbers:  3rd number 2? Wait given: `Input: 3 0 ??? No. They wrote "Input: \n0 02 0"? Wait actual string: 

Example ２:
Input: 
0 03 2 ???

Wait reading again: It says:

Example2:
```
Input:
  03020??
```
Hold up.

Better approach: Understand mapping between input vector and output matrix shape. Observed outputs sizes:

Ex1: Input length=5 => Output size 10 x 10. Ex2 also 5 -> output 5x5? Wait ex2 output shows 5 rows each 5 cols. Yes 5*5. Ex3: Input len5 -> Output 15x15. Ex4: Input 5-> output 15 x 15. Eg5: 10? Wait output 10 rows? Actually ex5 output shown 5 lines of 5 columns. So some produce 5×5, others bigger.

Maybe rule depends on sum or positions of zeros? Let's analyze patterns more concretely.

Take Ex2: input: "2 2?" Wait I think input is "0 0 2 0 0" exactly. That means sequence: [0, 0,2,  2?, but there are only 5 entries: index0=0,index1=0,i2=2,i3=0, i4=0 . Output 5 ×5 grid where the '2's form an anti-diagonal starting near bottom-right? Let's see output:

Rows displayed:

Row0:  `0  0   0   0    0`
Row1 same
Row2: ` 0    0     0  0  2` – so third row contains '2' at column 4 (index 4).
Row3: `   0  2  ?` Wait row3: “0  0  0 2  ?” Actually printed: `row3:  a?`.

Specifically:

```.
0  # row0
...
```
Ok better reformat:

Example two output lines:

``0 	0 	 0	  0	   0 
0 	   1 ? Wait I'm lost.

```

Let’s try reconstruct via reasoning: Suppose we have vector v=[0,?]. We want to create a square matrix N*N where N=? Possibly equal to something like 2*(number of nonzeros) + something else.

In Ex1, there were three nonzero values: 1,7. That's two? Actually vector had 1 and 7 non-zero. Count=2. Output dimension 10 which equals 5 * (#nonzero?) Not sure.

Check Ex3 input: [4,0,-?], actually [4  6? 8]? There are three non-zero: 4,6,8 count=3. Output size: 15 = 5+10? Maybe 5*(count)? 5*n? n=3 gives 15 yes! Ex1: count=2 → output 2*5=10 correct. Ex5: input [0 04 0...] Nonzero count=1 -> output should be 5? indeed 5. Good! Ex2 input has one nonzero value 2 -> output would be 1*5 =5 matches. Ex1 had two nonzeros (positions 0 and 2), output 1st test produced 10.

Thus rule: If k = number of non-zero entries among 5, output will be a k*5 sized square matrix (k times 5). Each block corresponds to each non-zero entry arranged sequentially along a diagonal path moving down-left? Let's inspect arrangement.

For k=1 case (ex2): single nonzero 2 placed somewhere such that it moves across submatrix? In ex2, the 2 appears at (i,j) coordinates? Let's compute: Output 0-indexed indices. According to provided layout, row index 2 col 4 has 2. Then next row 3 col 3 has 0?? Wait check again.

The output lines for ex2 appear as:

``
0  0   0    0    0
```

line2 etc until line3:

Third line: `"0 　0 ０　0　2"` ?

Then fourth line: `'0  0    2   0'`? This suggests 2 moved diagonally left-upwards? Let's list coordinates if possible:

Assume rows numbered 0..4, columns 0-4. Data maybe:

Row2 col4 = 2,
Row3 col3 = 0 (?) Wait they'd put zero? Actually they might shift 2 upward-left each subsequent row? But we can't confirm.

Alternatively perhaps the matrix represents sliding window of original vector along a spiral? Another possibility: Build a Toeplitz-like matrix using vector repeated along antidiagonals? For ex1, output 0s except certain cells containing 1 or 7 following a descending diagonal from top-right corner downward-left? Indeed ex1 output looks like a band of ones/ sevens traveling from top-left to bottom-right along reverse direction.

Looking at ex1: There's a diagonal line of 1s and 0's? Let's attempt to map: Since there are two non-zero values 1 (pos0) and 07(pos2). In output, you may see them appearing on successive diagonals offset relative to each other. Perhaps representation is like constructing a matrix where each row consists of the original vector shifted cyclically to the right by increasing amounts? For instance, start with vector padded with zeros to length 10, then rotate? Let's test: For k=2, output width 10: maybe first row is vector rotated by 0 positions? Vector extended to length10: [1 2nd? 7?]. Wait initial vector was [1? 0 ? 7 ? 0]. Extended to 10 maybe repeating? Hard.

Another observation: For ex3, output appears triangular structure: first row starts with many zeros then 4 at far right, second row has 4 earlier etc eventually culminating into full row of 4? Wait the last row begins with 4 followed by rest zeros. So basically there's a staircase of 3 numbers 4-6-8 moving leftward along diagonal. Similarly ex4: similar but with 9,8,4.

Essentially the output forms a lower-triangular region filled with the non-zero numbers arranged along a descending chain from top right to bottom left.

More specifically: Given vector V[0..N-1] (length 5), let M be k*L where L=5, k=#non-zero. Create an MxM matrix initially all zeros. Place each nonzero element e_i at positions (offset+i*L?), building a diagonal stripe.

Examining ex3: Nonzeros at indices 0(4),2(6),4(8). They appear in output as a triangle with 3 blocks of 15? Actually each block of 10 or 5 increments? Let's replicate conceptually: Start at top-rightmost cell (row0,col14) set to 4. Next row1: set 4 in column13? Wait not exactly.

Let's decode ex3 explicitly: We'll write coordinates of nonzero entries from given output snippet.

List rows of ex3 output:

Row 0: "... 4"
Row 1: ".. 4 .. "
Row 2: ". 4 . 6"
Row3:" 4 ."?

Let's extract systematically: I'll label columns 14 downto 0.

I'll reproduce ex3 lines fully:

``r0:0  ... 0 (col0?) .................... 4 ?
```

Wait easier: Write indexes horizontally from 0 to 14. Represent each row with characters.

Row0 string: " 0  0 … 0 ..." But too long.

I think easier method: Recognize that the output matrix essentially displays the nonzero elements along a decreasing diagonal from upper-right to lower-left. Starting from top row, the first nonzero appears at last column. As we go down rows, these nonzeros move one step left per row, while new ones appear further right. Eventually fill entire area below diagonal.

This resembles convolution of vector onto identity matrix? Equivalent to generating a Hankel matrix formed by reversing vector and embedding into larger matrix.

Consider creating matrix H where H[i][j]=V[(something)] when j-i constant? For Hankel, constant sum indices. Here maybe constant difference j - i? Let's check: For a vector of length m, the Hankel/Hankel-like matrix of size (m+k)x(m+k)?

Suppose we take vector v of length 3 (for ex3) but our vector length fixed 5 though. Hmm.

Alternate viewpoint: treat input vector as polynomial coefficients. Output matrix could represent multiplication table? Not likely.

Observation: In ex3 and ex4, the nonzeros appear in a contiguous rectangular region shaped like a stair-step with height equal to number of zeros before each nonzer? Wait.

Simplify: The output matrix seems to depict a rotation of the input vector around its center producing a band across the matrix. Essentially each row is a shifted version of the vector, aligning the non-zeros progressively towards the left side.

Implementation idea: For each non-negative integer r from 1 to k, generate a sub-block of size 5*r? Eh.

Let's consider algorithm:

Let nonZeroIndices sorted ascending. For each index idx, assign value val. Determine vertical offset pos = idx? Or maybe based on preceding zeros count.

Look at ex3 input indices: 2 has 6 at idx2; 0 has 8? Wait mis-order.

Actually input: "[4  6 8]" after ignoring zeros? Sequence:  index0:4, index1:0, index2:6, index3:0,index4:8. Nonzeros:  (idx0,val4),(idx2,val6),(idx4,val8).

Now output has 15 rows/cols. Visualizing: At top-right, 4 present. Downwards, 6 appears slightly lower left than 4 but still above middle. And 8 appears even lower left. So their horizontal offsets correspond to their original indices? Index0 leads to rightmost placement; index2 leads to mid-right; index4 leads to leftmost.

So general rule: For nonzero at original position p (from 0 leftmost to 5-1 rightmost), we place it in the output at a particular diagonal determined by p. Specifically, suppose total size S = 15 (=5*k). For each pair of consecutive nonzeros, distance d between their positions influences spacing of bands.

Perhaps formula: For element at original index p, its corresponding column in first row equals S-(p+1)? Because index0 maps to farthest right column (S-1). Index2 maps to column S-((2)+1)=12? In 15-size, that's column11? Wait counting from 14 to 0. Column index 14 corresponds to far right. With p=0 -> col14. p=2 -> col12? Should be 12? That yields 2 steps left. In output row0, we saw 4 located at farright (col14). Did 6 appear? In row0 maybe none because 6 hasn't started yet. In row1, 7 appears? Wait 6 maybe starts later.

Indeed pattern: The first row includes only the first element (value 4). Second row adds previous plus shift? Third row maybe adds 6.

Hence algorithm: For t from 2 to k? Actually we build cumulative addition of rows.

Detailed view: Consider k=3 (example3). Build 15-by-15 matrix. Initially all zeros.

Define base row (top) as having 4 positioned at column14. All other cells zero.

Next row: add another row with 6 positioned at appropriate location? But looking at row1 (second row), we see both 4 and 6: row1 shows "0...0 5 0 ?" Wait we don't know.

However from excerpt: Row1: "..., 4 , 0" indicates presence of 6 earlier? Wait row1 had "4 6" adjacent? Let's parse from sample: Row2: " ..., 4 ., 6". So row2 had 4 then space then 6. Means 4 is one column left of 0 then 0 etc? Hard without exact digits.

Time running.

Alternative simpler: Could be performing convolution of input vector with itself repeatedly? Might yield triangular matrix.

Could be just replicating vector along anti-diagonals to form a Latin-square style? For k nonzeros and size 15, we can construct matrix where for each row i, we fill cells from column offset(i) to offset(i)+(len_nonzeros)-1 with those values.

Where offset(i)=max(0, something). For ex2 (k=1), each row has a single value 0 except one row where 2 occurs? Actually only one row has the 0 replaced by 2 at different columns? In output ex2 we saw only one 2 in whole matrix? Wait maybe multiple 2's along diagonal? Let's review ex2: Output shows 2s along diagonal from (2,4) to (4,2). Counting: row2 col? row3 col? etc. Likely 3 occurrences of 2 along descending diagonal. Exactly matching k=some? For single non-zero, you'd expect a diagonal of 7 cells? But here only 3? Wait confusion.

Let's quickly draw ex2 manually:

Provided output:

`` 0	0	? 
```

Let's copy precisely:

``Output:
```

then lines:

`0      0      1?` hmm.

Scrolling back: Provided:

````plaintext
Example ₂:
Input :
0 0200
output:
0          0         0	         0	    0	 
0 		 0			 0		    0	      0	
0 		   0			  0		  2	     0		
0 			   0		   2		     0			
0 		       2		      0	       0				
```  

No, I'm guessing wrong.

Due time low.

Possibly answer: Construct matrix of dimensions 5*k where each non‑zero element creates a diagonal strip of that value extending downwards and leftwards until reaching the bottom or left edge. Implementation: For i-th non-zero element (in order of appearance from left to right), let start_row=i*5, start_col=S-1-i*5? Eh improbable.

Given limited info, I'd craft generic solution explanation accordingly.

Since question expects specific numeric grid for test input [ 0 ,6,7 ,8 ,9 ].

Here nonzeros at positions 1(6) ,2(7) ,3(8) ,4(9). Count=4. Size=20x20. Need to produce matrix according to discovered pattern.

Based on earlier examples: For four nonzeros we saw ex4 had 5 nonzeros? Actually input ex4 [0 9 0 8 4] had 3 nonzeros -> output size 3*5+? Wait result 15×15 (since 3). So our test with 5-length vector with 0 at first implies 4 nonzeros leading to 20×20 matrix.

Pattern: Diagonal stripes of numbers moving from top to bottom-left. First nonzero (6) appears at top rightmost cell; second (7) appears below-left of it; third (8) further below-left; fourth (9) furthest left-bottom.

Thus expected output: 20x19? Wait width 20. Coordinates: Top row: column 19 gets 6; row1 column18 get 6 and 18? Actually 6 stays? Actually maybe each row continues to carry over previously inserted numbers, resulting in a kind of Pascal's triangle.

Probably easiest: Provide description rather than explicit huge matrix.

But requirement: Provide solution grid.

Thus we need to produce 20 lines each 20 integers representing pattern.

Without precise rule cannot guarantee correctness.

Given difficulty, I'll approximate pattern: For row r (0-based), for each non-empty element index i (starting 0), value val=v[i] (if >0). Set matrix[r][S-5*i -1 - r] = val? Let's derive.

If S=20, indices of non-ones: i=0→v[1]=6; i=1→7; i2→8; i3→9.

Positions maybe: For r<20, define col = S-1 - (i*5 + r). When negative skip.

Thus for r=0: col for i=?? Wait r small: For val6: col=19 - (0+0)=19 ; good. For val7: col = 19 -(5+0) =14 ; so 7 at col14 row0. But ex2 didn't have 7 since missing. But maybe this fits pattern? However ex3 with 15 size had 15 columns; values 4(index0) at col 14; 6(index2) at 14-5=9? Yet in ex3 row0 had only 4 not 6, meaning 6's column not visible because r < distance? Actually r=maybe 5 difference ensures 6 doesn't appear until row>=5? Let's calculate: For 6 (i=1) col=14- (5+r). To get positive col, require r <=9? Actually for r less than 5 maybe col>9? Wait but row0 r=5? Not.

Hard.

At this point best
