Wait expected output shows [[1,1,??]. Let's check: Provided \"expected output\" maybe wrong? They say output grid: [[1 ,1 , ?]] Actually they wrote: Expected output grid:[[1, 1, 1],[1,0,1],[...]]. So yes it's a ring of ones around central zero. That seems like transform: fill entire border cells with 1s (or color) while leaving interior unchanged? But there may be other rules: For any non-zero pixel in input, set its orthogonal neighbors to that sam"
