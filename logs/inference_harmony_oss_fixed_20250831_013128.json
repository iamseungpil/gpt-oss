Output grids vary in size.\n\nObservations:\n\nExample1 Input: \"1  0   7   0    0\". So array A = [1,0,7,0 ,0]. Output grid is 10x10 (size?). Let's examine output of Example1: It's symmetrical along main diagonal maybe reversed order? Actually look at first row: \"0  1\" last element 1? Wait first row has '... 1' at end? Provided:\n\nRow1: 0 0 … 1 (last). Row2 ends with ... 1 at position second-to-last? Let's copy:\n\nGiven:\n\n0  | 0 | 1?? Wait let's parse properly.\n\nThey show each line as 10 columns. For example, first line: \n`0 00 00 … 01`. Let me rewrite:\n\nLine1: `0 000 001 0? No.\n\nLet's transcribe from text:\n\n```\n0  & 0 & 1?\n```\n\n",
