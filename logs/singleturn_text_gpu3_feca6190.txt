We need to analyze given two example transformations from small grids (5x? Actually inputs appear as single rows of length 5). The outputs are larger square matrices, maybe 10x10 for first case; second output appears 5x5 but rotated or something.

Let's parse Example 1:

Input: "1  0   7   0    0" a 1D array of length5 with values [1,0,7,0 ,0]. Output: 10 lines each containing 10 numbers. Let's examine pattern: It seems like we have diagonal shift of that sequence across matrix. Observing first few rows:

Row0: 0 ... 0 then at column9 value 1.
Row1: col8=1? Wait Row1 shows "... 1 at index 8"? Provided row1: "0  1?? let's read carefully".

Given output lines:

Line1:  000000001? Actually they show: 
```
0 3? no it's '0 4? hold on.

They wrote:
0 0 ... etc.

Let's transcribe exactly:

First row: `0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1` ??? Hard due formatting.

But I think pattern: It's basically placing the original vector along anti-diagonals such that it forms a spiral? Let's check more concretely.

From description: For input [a,b,c,d,e] produce 10×10 where each row i has the vector shifted leftwards relative to previous row? Eg row0 ends with e? But there is only one non-zero element in each row except some zeros.

Look at row0: last number 1. So row0 contains 1 somewhere near end. Row1: second-to-last position 1? They say row1 includes 1 also plus other numbers? Wait row1 shows "… 1". Actually row1 might contain 1 and 0? Let's inspect all rows:

Rows list:

row0: `1  ?` Wait actual string: "output:" followed by many lines. I'll copy them:

```
output:
0     0     … 0      1  
0     ...        1   1?
...
```

This is messy.

Maybe easier: Recognize known ARC problem: This looks like rotating the input vector around center forming a diagonal cross shape. In Example 2, input `[0
