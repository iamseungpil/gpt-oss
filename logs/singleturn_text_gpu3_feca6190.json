The outputs are larger square matrices, maybe 10x10 for first case; second output appears 5x5 but rotated or something.\n\nLet's parse Example 1:\n\nInput: \"1  0   7   0    0\" a 1D array of length5 with values [1,0,7,0 ,0]. Output: 10 lines each containing 10 numbers. Let's examine pattern: It seems like we have diagonal shift of that sequence across matrix. Observing first few rows:\n\nRow0: 0 ... 0 then at column9 value 1.\nRow1: col8=1? Wait Row1 shows \"... 1 at index 8\"? "
