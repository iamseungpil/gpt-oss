Output: a larger grid. Let's examine each example.\n\nExample 1: Input: 1 0 7 0 0\nOutput: 10x10 grid. Let's analyze pattern. Input row: [1,0,7,0,0]. Output is a 10x10 grid. Let's examine the output matrix. I'll rewrite as coordinates. Represent output as 10 rows each of length 10. Let's list rows:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nRow1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 7\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 7 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 7 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 1 0 7 0 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 1 0 7 0 0 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 1 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\nRow8: 0 1 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow9: 1 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo pattern: The input row of length 5 appears to be a pattern of 1,0,7,0,0. The output grid is 10x10. It appears that the input row is repeated diagonally across the grid? Let's see: The diagonal from bottom-left to top-right? Actually the bottom row of output (row9) is exactly the input row plus zeros at end: 1 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So input row appended with zeros to length 10. Similarly, row8: 0 1 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0. Row7: 0 0 1 0 7 0 0 0 0 0. So each row above is the input row shifted one to the right. So the pattern is a diagonal of the input row across the grid, forming a \"staircase\" shape. So the output grid is 10x10, which is 2 * input length? Actually input length = 5. Output size = 10x10. So maybe output grid is of size 2*N by 2*N? Let's check Example 2: Input length 5: [0,0,2,0,0]. Output: 5x5 grid. Wait Example 2 output is 5x5. Let's check: Row0: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 2\nRow3: 0 0 0 2 0\nRow4: 0 0 2 0 0\n\nSo output size 5x5. That's equal to input length. But Example 1 output size 10x10, which is double input length. So maybe output size is 2*N? But Example 3: Input length 5. Output size: 15x15? Let's check Example 3 output: 15 rows each of 15 numbers. Yes, 15x15. So output size = 3*N? Because 5*3=15. Example 4: Input length 5. Output size 15x15 as well. Example 5: Input length 5. Output size 5x5. Wait Example 5 output: 5x5. Yes. So output size varies: 5x5, 10x10, 15x15. So maybe output size is N + (N-1)? Let's compute: Example 1: N=5, output size 10 = N + (N-? ) Actually 10 = 2*N. Example 2: N=5, output size 5 = N? Example 3: N=5, output size 15 = 3*N. Example 4: N=5, output size 15 = 3*N. Example 5: N=5, output size 5 = N. So pattern depends on something else. Perhaps output size is determined by number of non-zero values in input? Let's examine each input:\n\nExample 1 input: [1,0,7,0,0] has two non-zero values: 1 and 7. Example 2 input: [0,0,2,0,0] has one non-zero value: 2. Example 3 input: [4,0,6,0,8] has three non-zero values: 4,6,8. Example 4 input: [0,9,0,8,4] has three non-zero values: 9,8,4. Example 5 input: [0,4,0,0,0] has one non-zero value: 4.\n\nOutput size maybe 5 + (#non-zero -1)*5? Let's test: For Example 1 (#non-zero=2). 5 + (2-1)*5 = 10. Yes. Example 2 (#non-zero=1). 5 + (1-1)*5 = 5. Yes. Example 3 (#non-zero=3). 5 + (3-1)*5 = 15. Yes. Example 4 (#non-zero=3). 5 + (3-1)*5 = 15. Yes. Example 5 (#non-zero=1). 5 + (1-1)*5 = 5. Yes. So output grid size = 5 + (k-1)*5 where k = number of non-zero entries in input row. That is N + (k-1)*N = k*N? Wait N=5. So output size = k*N? Because N=5, k*N = 5*k. Let's test: Example 1: k=2, 5*2=10. Example 2: k=1, 5*1=5. Example 3: k=3, 5*3=15. Example 4: k=3, 5*3=15. Example 5: k=1, 5*1=5. So yes, output size = k*N. So the output grid is of dimension (k*N) x (k*N). So we replicate the input row along a diagonal across a grid of size k*N.\n\nNow we need to understand how the values are arranged. Let's analyze Example 1 again: Input: [1,0,7,0,0]. k=2. Output size 10x10. The pattern: The input row appears along a diagonal of width 5? Let's check the positions of non-zero values: In output, the non-zero values are 1 and 7. They appear in each row offset by one. Actually each row has a 1 and 7, but at different positions. Let's map the coordinates of 1 and 7. For each row r from 0 to 9:\n\nRow0: 1 at col9\nRow1: 1 at col8\nRow2: 1 at col7, 7 at col9? Wait row2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 7. So 1 at col7, 7 at col9.\nRow3: 1 at col6, 7 at col8\nRow4: 1 at col5, 7 at col7\nRow5: 1 at col4, 7 at col6\nRow6: 1 at col3, 7 at col5\nRow7: 1 at col2, 7 at col4\nRow8: 1 at col1, 7 at col3\nRow9: 1 at col0, 7 at col2\n\nSo each row has 1 and 7. They appear in positions that shift left by one each row. And the 1 and 7 maintain the relative offset of 2? Actually in input, 1 at index0, 7 at index2. So difference is 2 indices. In output, the difference between columns of 1 and 7 is also 2: e.g., row0: 1 at col9, 7 at col9? Wait row0 has only 1 at col9 and no 7. So maybe for row0 we only have 1 at col9, 7 at col? Wait row0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1. There's no 7. So row0 only has 1. Row1: 1 at col8, no 7. Row2: 1 at col7, 7 at col9. So difference 2. Row3: 1 at col6, 7 at col8 difference 2. Row4: 1 at col5, 7 at col7 diff 2. Row5: 1 at col4, 7 at col6 diff 2. Row6: 1 at col3, 7 at col5 diff 2. Row7: 1 at col2, 7 at col4 diff 2. Row8: 1 at col1, 7 at col3 diff 2. Row9: 1 at col0, 7 at col2 diff 2.\n\nSo for rows 2-9, both 1 and 7 appear. For rows 0-1, only 1 appears. This suggests that the pattern is the input row repeated along a diagonal, but truncated at edges. Let's analyze Example 3: Input: [4,0,6,0,8]. k=3. Output size 15x15. Let's examine output: Row0: 4 at col14? Wait row0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. So 4 at col14. Row1: 4 at col13. Row2: 4 at col12, 6 at col14? Wait row2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6. So 4 at col12, 6 at col14. Row3: 4 at col11, 6 at col13. Row4: 4 at col10, 6 at col12, 8 at col14? Wait row4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8? Wait row4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8? Actually row4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8? Let's check the output row list: Provided in example 3 output:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\nRow1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 0 0\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 0 0 0\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\nRow10: 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow11: 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow12: 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow13: 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow14: 4 0 6 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo each row has 4,6,8 maybe. Let's check row0: only 4 at col14. Row1: 4 at col13. Row2: 4 at col12, 6 at col14. Row3: 4 at col11, 6 at col13. Row4: 4 at col10, 6 at col12, 8 at col14. Row5: 4 at col9, 6 at col11, 8 at col13. Row6: 4 at col8, 6 at col10, 8 at col12. Row7: 4 at col7, 6 at col9, 8 at col11. Row8: 4 at col6, 6 at col8, 8 at col10. Row9: 4 at col5, 6 at col7, 8 at col9. Row10: 4 at col4, 6 at col6, 8 at col8. Row11: 4 at col3, 6 at col5, 8 at col7. Row12: 4 at col2, 6 at col4, 8 at col6. Row13: 4 at col1, 6 at col3, 8 at col5. Row14: 4 at col0, 6 at col2, 8 at col4.\n\nThus pattern: The input row [4,0,6,0,8] has non-zero values at indices 0,2,4. Output grid is 15x15. The pattern shows that the input row is repeated along a diagonal, but the pattern extends for 15 rows. Each row has up to 3 non-zero values. The positions shift left by one each row. At the topmost rows, only the last element appears? Let's analyze: Row0: only 4 at col14. Row1: 4 at col13. Row2: 4 at col12, 6 at col14. Row3: 4 at col11, 6 at col13. Row4: 4 at col10, 6 at col12, 8 at col14. Row5: 4 at col9, 6 at col11, 8 at col13. Row6: 4 at col8, 6 at col10, 8 at col12. Row7: 4 at col7, 6 at col9, 8 at col11. Row8: 4 at col6, 6 at col8, 8 at col10. Row9: 4 at col5, 6 at col7, 8 at col9. Row10: 4 at col4, 6 at col6, 8 at col8. Row11: 4 at col3, 6 at col5, 8 at col7. Row12: 4 at col2, 6 at col4, 8 at col6. Row13: 4 at col1, 6 at col3, 8 at col5. Row14: 4 at col0, 6 at col2, 8 at col4.\n\nSo pattern: The input row is repeated along a \"staircase\" from top-right to bottom-left, but truncated at edges. For each row r from 0 to 14, we place the non-zero elements of the input row at positions col = (size-1 - r + shift?), but maybe easier: We can think of generating a matrix by sliding the input row across the grid along a diagonal from bottom-left to top-right. Equivalent to: For each row r from 0 to size-1, we compute an offset = r? Actually for row r, the non-zero elements appear at columns such that the relative positions of the input row's non-zero elements are preserved. In Example 1, input row has non-zero at positions 0 and 2. In output, for row r, the non-zero positions are at columns c1 = (size-1 - r) for element 1? Let's test: size=10. For row9 (bottom row), r=9. size-1 - r = 0. Indeed 1 at col0. For row8, r=8, size-1 - r = 1. 1 at col1. For row7, r=7, size-1 - r = 2. 1 at col2. For row6, r=6, size-1 - r = 3. 1 at col3. So yes, 1 appears at column (size-1 - r). So 1 is placed at column (size-1 - r). For 7, input position 2. For row r, 7 appears at column (size-1 - r + 2)? Let's test: For row9, r=9, size-1 - r = 0. +2 = 2. 7 at col2. Yes. For row8, r=8, size-1 - r = 1. +2 = 3. 7 at col3. For row7, r=7, size-1 - r = 2. +2 = 4. 7 at col4. Good. For row2, r=2, size-1 - r = 7. +2 = 9. 7 at col9. Yes. So pattern: For each non-zero element in input at index i, we place it at column (size-1 - r + i) in row r. But we need to ensure we don't go out of bounds. For some rows, the computed column may be >= size or <0. In those rows, the element is omitted. In Example 1, for row0, r=0, size-1 - r = 9. For element 1 (i=0): col=9+0=9. So 1 at col9. For element 7 (i=2): col=9+2=11 >9, out of bounds, so omitted. For row1, r=1, size-1 - r = 8. 1 at col8. 7 at col10 >9, omitted. For row2, r=2, size-1 - r = 7. 1 at col7. 7 at col9. So that matches. So indeed the rule is: For each non-zero element in input at index i, for each row r from 0 to size-1, compute col = (size-1 - r + i). If col in [0, size-1], place element there. Equivalent to sliding the input row across the grid diagonally from top-right to bottom-left. The grid size is k*N where k is number of non-zero elements. For Example 2: Input: [0,0,2,0,0]. k=1. size=5. For each row r, col = size-1 - r + i (i=2). So col = 4 - r + 2 = 6 - r. For r=0, col=6 -> out of bounds. So omitted. For r=1, col=5 -> out of bounds. For r=2, col=4 -> in bounds, 2 at col4. For r=3, col=3 -> 2 at col3. For r=4, col=2 -> 2 at col2. That matches output: row2: col4, row3: col3, row4: col2. So yes.\n\nFor Example 3: Input [4,0,6,0,8], N=5, k=3, size=15. For each non-zero element at indices i=0,2,4. For each row r, compute col = (size-1 - r + i). For r=0: size-1 - r = 14. For i=0: col=14. Place 4 at col14. For i=2: col=16 >14 -> omitted. For i=4: col=18 >14 -> omitted. So row0 only has 4 at col14. For r=1: size-1 - r = 13. i=0 -> col13. i=2 -> col15 >14 omitted. i=4 -> col17 omitted. So row1 only 4 at col13. For r=2: size-1 - r = 12. i=0 -> col12. i=2 -> col14. i=4 -> col16 omitted. So row2 has 4 at col12, 6 at col14. Wait 6 at col14? But 6 is at i=2. Yes. So row2: 4 at col12, 6 at col14. That matches output: row2: 4 at col12, 6 at col14. For r=3: size-1 - r = 11. i=0 -> col11. i=2 -> col13. i=4 -> col15 omitted. So row3: 4 at col11, 6 at col13. That matches output. Continue: r=4: size-1 - r = 10. i=0 -> col10. i=2 -> col12. i=4 -> col14. So row4: 4 at col10, 6 at col12, 8 at col14. That matches output. So rule holds.\n\nFor Example 4: Input [0,9,0,8,4], indices of non-zero: i=1 (value 9), i=3 (value 8), i=4 (value 4). N=5, k=3, size=15. For r=0: size-1 - r = 14. i=1 -> col15 >14 omitted. i=3 -> col17 omitted. i=4 -> col18 omitted. So row0: no values? Wait output row0: all zeros. Yes. Row1: size-1 - r = 13. i=1 -> col14 -> 9 at col14. i=3 -> col16 omitted. i=4 -> col17 omitted. So row1: 9 at col14. Output row1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9. Yes. Row2: size-1 - r = 12. i=1 -> col13 -> 9 at col13. i=3 -> col15 omitted. i=4 -> col16 omitted. So row2: 9 at col13. Output row2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0. Wait row2: 9 at col13? Actually output row2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0. That means 9 at col13. Yes. Row3: size-1 - r = 11. i=1 -> col12 -> 9 at col12. i=3 -> col14 -> 8 at col14. i=4 -> col15 omitted. So row3: 9 at col12, 8 at col14. Output row3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 8. Yes. Row4: size-1 - r = 10. i=1 -> col11 -> 9 at col11. i=3 -> col13 -> 8 at col13. i=4 -> col14 -> 4 at col14. So row4: 9 at col11, 8 at col13, 4 at col14. Output row4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 8 4. Yes. Row5: size-1 - r = 9. i=1 -> col10 -> 9 at col10. i=3 -> col12 -> 8 at col12. i=4 -> col13 -> 4 at col13. Output row5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 8 4 0. Yes. Row6: size-1 - r = 8. i=1 -> col9 -> 9 at col9. i=3 -> col11 -> 8 at col11. i=4 -> col12 -> 4 at col12. Output row6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 8 4 0 0. Yes. Row7: size-1 - r = 7. i=1 -> col8 -> 9 at col8. i=3 -> col10 -> 8 at col10. i=4 -> col11 -> 4 at col11. Output row7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 8 4 0 0 0. Yes. Row8: size-1 - r = 6. i=1 -> col7 -> 9 at col7. i=3 -> col9 -> 8 at col9. i=4 -> col10 -> 4 at col10. Output row8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 8 4 0 0 0 0. Yes. Row9: size-1 - r = 5. i=1 -> col6 -> 9 at col6. i=3 -> col8 -> 8 at col8. i=4 -> col9 -> 4 at col9. Output row9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0. Yes. Row10: size-1 - r = 4. i=1 -> col5 -> 9 at col5. i=3 -> col7 -> 8 at col7. i=4 -> col8 -> 4 at col8. Output row10: 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Yes. Row11: size-1 - r = 3. i=1 -> col4 -> 9 at col4. i=3 -> col6 -> 8 at col6. i=4 -> col7 -> 4 at col7. Output row11: 0 0 0 0 9 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Yes. Row12: size-1 - r = 2. i=1 -> col3 -> 9 at col3. i=3 -> col5 -> 8 at col5. i=4 -> col6 -> 4 at col6. Output row12: 0 0 0 9 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Yes. Row13: size-1 - r = 1. i=1 -> col2 -> 9 at col2. i=3 -> col4 -> 8 at col4. i=4 -> col5 -> 4 at col5. Output row13: 0 0 9 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Yes. Row14: size-1 - r = 0. i=1 -> col1 -> 9 at col1. i=3 -> col3 -> 8 at col3. i=4 -> col4 -> 4 at col4. Output row14: 0 9 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Yes.\n\nSo the rule holds for all examples.\n\nExample 5: Input [0,4,0,0,0]. N=5, k=1. size=5. Input non-zero at index i=1, value 4. For each row r, col = size-1 - r + i = 4 - r + 1 = 5 - r. For r=0, col=5 -> out of bounds. For r=1, col=4 -> 4 at col4. For r=2, col=3 -> 4 at col3. For r=3, col=2 -> 4 at col2. For r=4, col=1 -> 4 at col1. That matches output: row1: 4 at col4, row2: 4 at col3, row3: 4 at col2, row4: 4 at col1. Output row0 all zeros. So rule holds.\n\nThus transformation rule: For input row of length N, let k be number of non-zero elements. Output grid size is (k*N) x (k*N). For each non-zero element in input at index i (0-indexed), we will place it in each row r of the output grid at column col = (k*N - 1 - r + i). If col is in [0, k*N-1], we place the value. All other cells remain 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of constructing a diagonal pattern: The input row is placed at the bottom-left corner of the output grid (starting at row k*N-1, column 0). Then we shift it leftwards one column per row upwards, so that the input row moves along the diagonal from bottom-left to top-right. Because the input row may have multiple non-zero elements, we get a \"staircase\" shape.\n\nBut we need to confirm that the input row is placed at the bottom-left corner of the output grid. In Example 1, bottom row row9 has input row at col0-col4: 1,0,7,0,0. Yes. Example 3 bottom row row14 has input row at col0-col4: 4,0,6,0,8. Yes. Example 4 bottom row row14 has input row at col0-col4: 0,9,0,8,4. Yes. Example 5 bottom row row4 has input row at col0-col4: 0,4,0,0,0. Yes. So indeed the input row is placed at the bottom-left of the output grid.\n\nThus the algorithm: Let N = length of input row. Count k = number of non-zero elements in input row. Let S = k*N. Create SxS grid of zeros. For each row r from 0 to S-1, compute offset = S-1 - r. For each index i in input row where value v != 0, compute col = offset + i. If 0 <= col < S, set grid[r][col] = v.\n\nAlternatively, we could fill the grid by sliding the input row along the diagonal: For each shift s from 0 to S-1, we place the input row at row = S-1 - s, col = s. But that would only place the entire input row at one position, not sliding each element individually. Actually we can think of each shift s as placing the input row at row = S-1 - s, col = s. But then we would need to place the entire input row at that position, but if we do that for each shift s, we would end up with overlapping rows? Wait, let's test: For Example 1, S=10. For shift s=0: place input row at row=9, col=0. That yields row9: 1,0,7,0,0 at col0-col4. For shift s=1: place input row at row=8, col=1. That yields row8: 0,1,0,7,0 at col1-col5. But we need row8: 0 1 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0. Actually row8 has 1 at col1, 7 at col3. That matches. For shift s=2: place input row at row=7, col=2. That yields row7: 0 0 1 0 7 0 at col2-col6. That matches. For shift s=3: place input row at row=6, col=3. That yields row6: 0 0 0 1 0 7 0 at col3-col7. That matches. For shift s=4: place input row at row=5, col=4. That yields row5: 0 0 0 0 1 0 7 0 at col4-col8. That matches. For shift s=5: place input row at row=4, col=5. That yields row4: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 7 0 at col5-col9. That matches. For shift s=6: place input row at row=3, col=6. That yields row3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 7 0 at col6-col10? Wait col10 out of bounds? Actually col=6, col+N-1 = 10, out of bounds. So we only place up to col=9. So row3: 1 at col6, 7 at col8? Wait row3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 7 0. That matches: 1 at col6, 7 at col8. So indeed the sliding approach works: For each shift s from 0 to S-1, we place the input row at row = S-1 - s, starting at col = s, but only up to col < S. But we must also handle overlapping values: If two placements place a value at the same cell, what happens? In our examples, there is no overlap because each cell is only written once. But let's test: For Example 3, S=15. For shift s=0: place input row at row=14, col=0. That yields row14: 4 0 6 0 8 at col0-col4. Good. For shift s=1: place input row at row=13, col=1. That yields row13: 0 4 0 6 0 8 at col1-col5. That matches. For shift s=2: place input row at row=12, col=2. That yields row12: 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 at col2-col6. That matches. For shift s=3: row=11, col=3: 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 at col3-col7. That matches. For shift s=4: row=10, col=4: 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 at col4-col8. That matches. For shift s=5: row=9, col=5: 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 at col5-col9. That matches. For shift s=6: row=8, col=6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 at col6-col10. That matches. For shift s=7: row=7, col=7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 at col7-col11. That matches. For shift s=8: row=6, col=8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 at col8-col12. That matches. For shift s=9: row=5, col=9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 at col9-col13. That matches. For shift s=10: row=4, col=10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 8 at col10-col14. That matches. For shift s=11: row=3, col=11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0 at col11-col14? Wait col+N-1 = 15? Actually col=11, N=5, so col+N-1=15. But grid size is 15, indices 0-14. So col+N-1=15 >14, so we only place up to col=14. So row3: 4 at col11, 6 at col13? Actually col=11: 4 at col11, 0 at col12, 6 at col13, 0 at col14? Wait row3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 0. That matches: 4 at col11, 6 at col13. For shift s=12: row=2, col=12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 6 at col12-col14. That matches: 4 at col12, 6 at col14. For shift s=13: row=1, col=13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 at col13-col14. That matches: 4 at col13. For shift s=14: row=0, col=14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 at col14. That matches: 4 at col14. So the sliding approach works.\n\nThus the rule: The output grid is a diagonal sliding of the input row across a square grid of size (k*N). The input row is placed at the bottom-left corner, and each row above it shifts the row one position to the right (so that the row moves leftwards relative to the grid). Equivalent to: For each row r (0-indexed from top), the input row is placed at column offset = r? Wait, we can derive: For row r from 0 to S-1, the input row is placed at column offset = r? Actually if we think from top row 0 to bottom row S-1, the offset increases from 0 to S-1? But we saw that bottom row has offset 0, row above has offset 1, etc. So offset = S-1 - r. Yes. So for row r, we place input row at column offset = S-1 - r. But we only place the input row's elements at columns offset + i where i indexes the input row. So we can compute col = offset + i. That matches earlier formula: col = S-1 - r + i.\n\nThus the rule is consistent.\n\nNow we need to apply to the test input: Input: 0 6 7 8 9.\n\nLet's analyze input: [0,6,7,8,9]. N=5. Number of non-zero elements: Let's count. Input values: 0,6,7,8,9. Non-zero: 6,7,8,9 => 4 non-zero elements. So k=4. Output grid size: S = k*N = 4*5 = 20. So output grid is 20x20.\n\nWe need to compute output grid 20x20 following rule: For each row r from 0 to 19 (top to bottom), compute offset = S-1 - r = 19 - r. For each non-zero element in input at index i, value v, compute col = offset + i. If col in [0,19], place v at grid[r][col].\n\nAlternatively, we can generate the grid by sliding input row across the diagonal: For shift s from 0 to 19, place input row at row = S-1 - s, starting at col = s. But we need to ensure we only place elements that are within bounds. But this sliding approach is simpler: For shift s from 0 to 19, we place input row at row = 19 - s, starting at col = s. But we only place input elements that are non-zero. But we also need to handle partial placements: For shift s near the end, the input row may extend beyond the right boundary. But we only place up to col 19. So we need to compute for each shift s, for each index i in input row, if s+i <= 19, place v at row = 19 - s, col = s + i.\n\nLet's compute this systematically.\n\nInput row: indices: 0:0, 1:6, 2:7, 3:8, 4:9.\n\nWe have k=4 non-zero elements at indices 1,2,3,4 with values 6,7,8,9. So we will place them accordingly.\n\nLet's compute grid of 20 rows, 20 columns.\n\nWe can create an array of zeros: 20x20.\n\nNow for each row r from 0 to 19: compute offset = 19 - r. For each index i where input[i] != 0, compute col = offset + i. If 0 <= col < 20, set grid[r][col] = input[i].\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for each shift s from 0 to 19: row = 19 - s. For each i in input indices 1..4: col = s + i. If col < 20, set grid[row][col] = input[i].\n\nLet's compute row by row.\n\nWe will produce a 20x20 grid. Let's label rows 0-19.\n\nDefine offset = 19 - r.\n\nLet's compute for each r:\n\nRow 0: r=0, offset=19. For each i:\n- i=1: col=19+1=20 >19 -> out of bounds.\n- i=2: col=21 >19 -> out.\n- i=3: col=22 >19 -> out.\n- i=4: col=23 >19 -> out.\nSo row0 will be all zeros. That matches pattern: top row will be zeros.\n\nRow 1: r=1, offset=18. i=1: col=18+1=19 -> within bounds. Place value 6 at col19. i=2: col=18+2=20 >19 -> out. i=3: col=18+3=21 >19 -> out. i=4: col=18+4=22 >19 -> out. So row1 has 6 at col19. All others zeros.\n\nRow 2: r=2, offset=17. i=1: col=17+1=18 -> place 6 at col18. i=2: col=17+2=19 -> place 7 at col19. i=3: col=17+3=20 >19 -> out. i=4: col=17+4=21 >19 -> out. So row2: 6 at col18, 7 at col19.\n\nRow 3: r=3, offset=16. i=1: col=16+1=17 -> 6 at col17. i=2: col=16+2=18 -> 7 at col18. i=3: col=16+3=19 -> 8 at col19. i=4: col=16+4=20 >19 -> out. So row3: 6 at col17, 7 at col18, 8 at col19.\n\nRow 4: r=4, offset=15. i=1: col=15+1=16 -> 6 at col16. i=2: col=15+2=17 -> 7 at col17. i=3: col=15+3=18 -> 8 at col18. i=4: col=15+4=19 -> 9 at col19. So row4: 6 at col16, 7 at col17, 8 at col18, 9 at col19.\n\nRow 5: r=5, offset=14. i=1: col=14+1=15 -> 6 at col15. i=2: col=14+2=16 -> 7 at col16. i=3: col=14+3=17 -> 8 at col17. i=4: col=14+4=18 -> 9 at col18. So row5: 6 at col15, 7 at col16, 8 at col17, 9 at col18.\n\nRow 6: r=6, offset=13. i=1: col=13+1=14 -> 6 at col14. i=2: col=13+2=15 -> 7 at col15. i=3: col=13+3=16 -> 8 at col16. i=4: col=13+4=17 -> 9 at col17. So row6: 6 at col14, 7 at col15, 8 at col16, 9 at col17.\n\nRow 7: r=7, offset=12. i=1: col=12+1=13 -> 6 at col13. i=2: col=12+2=14 -> 7 at col14. i=3: col=12+3=15 -> 8 at col15. i=4: col=12+4=16 -> 9 at col16. So row7: 6 at col13, 7 at col14, 8 at col15, 9 at col16.\n\nRow 8: r=8, offset=11. i=1: col=11+1=12 -> 6 at col12. i=2: col=11+2=13 -> 7 at col13. i=3: col=11+3=14 -> 8 at col14. i=4: col=11+4=15 -> 9 at col15. So row8: 6 at col12, 7 at col13, 8 at col14, 9 at col15.\n\nRow 9: r=9, offset=10. i=1: col=10+1=11 -> 6 at col11. i=2: col=10+2=12 -> 7 at col12. i=3: col=10+3=13 -> 8 at col13. i=4: col=10+4=14 -> 9 at col14. So row9: 6 at col11, 7 at col12, 8 at col13, 9 at col14.\n\nRow 10: r=10, offset=9. i=1: col=9+1=10 -> 6 at col10. i=2: col=9+2=11 -> 7 at col11. i=3: col=9+3=12 -> 8 at col12. i=4: col=9+4=13 -> 9 at col13. So row10: 6 at col10, 7 at col11, 8 at col12, 9 at col13.\n\nRow 11: r=11, offset=8. i=1: col=8+1=9 -> 6 at col9. i=2: col=8+2=10 -> 7 at col10. i=3: col=8+3=11 -> 8 at col11. i=4: col=8+4=12 -> 9 at col12. So row11: 6 at col9, 7 at col10, 8 at col11, 9 at col12.\n\nRow 12: r=12, offset=7. i=1: col=7+1=8 -> 6 at col8. i=2: col=7+2=9 -> 7 at col9. i=3: col=7+3=10 -> 8 at col10. i=4: col=7+4=11 -> 9 at col11. So row12: 6 at col8, 7 at col9, 8 at col10, 9 at col11.\n\nRow 13: r=13, offset=6. i=1: col=6+1=7 -> 6 at col7. i=2: col=6+2=8 -> 7 at col8. i=3: col=6+3=9 -> 8 at col9. i=4: col=6+4=10 -> 9 at col10. So row13: 6 at col7, 7 at col8, 8 at col9, 9 at col10.\n\nRow 14: r=14, offset=5. i=1: col=5+1=6 -> 6 at col6. i=2: col=5+2=7 -> 7 at col7. i=3: col=5+3=8 -> 8 at col8. i=4: col=5+4=9 -> 9 at col9. So row14: 6 at col6, 7 at col7, 8 at col8, 9 at col9.\n\nRow 15: r=15, offset=4. i=1: col=4+1=5 -> 6 at col5. i=2: col=4+2=6 -> 7 at col6. i=3: col=4+3=7 -> 8 at col7. i=4: col=4+4=8 -> 9 at col8. So row15: 6 at col5, 7 at col6, 8 at col7, 9 at col8.\n\nRow 16: r=16, offset=3. i=1: col=3+1=4 -> 6 at col4. i=2: col=3+2=5 -> 7 at col5. i=3: col=3+3=6 -> 8 at col6. i=4: col=3+4=7 -> 9 at col7. So row16: 6 at col4, 7 at col5, 8 at col6, 9 at col7.\n\nRow 17: r=17, offset=2. i=1: col=2+1=3 -> 6 at col3. i=2: col=2+2=4 -> 7 at col4. i=3: col=2+3=5 -> 8 at col5. i=4: col=2+4=6 -> 9 at col6. So row17: 6 at col3, 7 at col4, 8 at col5, 9 at col6.\n\nRow 18: r=18, offset=1. i=1: col=1+1=2 -> 6 at col2. i=2: col=1+2=3 -> 7 at col3. i=3: col=1+3=4 -> 8 at col4. i=4: col=1+4=5 -> 9 at col5. So row18: 6 at col2, 7 at col3, 8 at col4, 9 at col5.\n\nRow 19: r=19, offset=0. i=1: col=0+1=1 -> 6 at col1. i=2: col=0+2=2 -> 7 at col2. i=3: col=0+3=3 -> 8 at col3. i=4: col=0+4=4 -> 9 at col4. So row19: 6 at col1, 7 at col2, 8 at col3, 9 at col4.\n\nThus we have the entire grid. Let's double-check that we didn't miss any placements: For each row, we placed values for indices 1-4, but not for index 0 because input[0] is 0. So there are no zeros for index 0. That matches pattern: For each row, we have 4 values placed in contiguous columns starting at offset+1? Actually we see that for each row, the values appear in columns offset+1, offset+2, offset+3, offset+4. So they occupy contiguous block of 4 cells, but there is no value at offset+0 because input[0] is 0. So each row has exactly 4 non-zero values, except top rows where some may be omitted due to out-of-bounds.\n\nWe can also verify that the bottom row row19 has 4 values at columns 1-4. The row above row18 has 4 values at columns 2-5. So indeed the pattern is sliding.\n\nNow we need to output the grid as a list of rows, each row containing 20 numbers separated by spaces. We must ensure that each row has 20 numbers. Let's construct each row explicitly.\n\nLet's create an array of 20 zeros for each row and fill the appropriate columns.\n\nWe'll produce the rows from 0 to 19.\n\nRow0: all zeros. So row0: 20 zeros. Let's write them: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow1: 6 at col19. So row1: 19 zeros, then 6? Actually 6 at col19 means last column. So row1: 19 zeros then 6. That is: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\"? Wait we need to check: col19 is the 20th element. So row1: first 19 zeros, then 6. So row1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\".\n\nRow2: 6 at col18, 7 at col19. So row2: 18 zeros, then 6, 7? Wait we need to count: col18 is 19th element, col19 is 20th element. So row2: 18 zeros, then 6, then 7. So: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7\".\n\nRow3: 6 at col17, 7 at col18, 8 at col19. So row3: 17 zeros, then 6, 7, 8. So: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8\".\n\nRow4: 6 at col16, 7 at col17, 8 at col18, 9 at col19. So row4: 16 zeros, then 6,7,8,9. So: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9\".\n\nRow5: 6 at col15, 7 at col16, 8 at col17, 9 at col18. So row5: 15 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then 0? Wait we need 20 columns: col15 is 16th element. So we need 15 zeros, then 6 at col15, 7 at col16, 8 at col17, 9 at col18, then col19 zero. So row5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0\".\n\nRow6: 6 at col14, 7 at col15, 8 at col16, 9 at col17. So row6: 14 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col18, col19? Wait we have 20 columns: indices 0-13 zeros (14 zeros), then 6 at col14, 7 at col15, 8 at col16, 9 at col17, then zeros at col18 and col19. So row6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0\".\n\nRow7: 6 at col13, 7 at col14, 8 at col15, 9 at col16. So row7: 13 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col17, col18, col19? Actually after col16, we have col17, col18, col19 zeros. So row7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0\".\n\nRow8: 6 at col12, 7 at col13, 8 at col14, 9 at col15. So row8: 12 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col16, col17, col18, col19. So row8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow9: 6 at col11, 7 at col12, 8 at col13, 9 at col14. So row9: 11 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col15, col16, col17, col18, col19. So row9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow10: 6 at col10, 7 at col11, 8 at col12, 9 at col13. So row10: 10 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col14, col15, col16, col17, col18, col19. So row10: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow11: 6 at col9, 7 at col10, 8 at col11, 9 at col12. So row11: 9 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col13, col14, col15, col16, col17, col18, col19. So row11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow12: 6 at col8, 7 at col9, 8 at col10, 9 at col11. So row12: 8 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col12, col13, col14, col15, col16, col17, col18, col19. So row12: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow13: 6 at col7, 7 at col8, 8 at col9, 9 at col10. So row13: 7 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col11, col12, col13, col14, col15, col16, col17, col18, col19. So row13: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow14: 6 at col6, 7 at col7, 8 at col8, 9 at col9. So row14: 6 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col10, col11, col12, col13, col14, col15, col16, col17, col18, col19. So row14: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow15: 6 at col5, 7 at col6, 8 at col7, 9 at col8. So row15: 5 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col9, col10, col11, col12, col13, col14, col15, col16, col17, col18, col19. So row15: \"0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow16: 6 at col4, 7 at col5, 8 at col6, 9 at col7. So row16: 4 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col8, col9, col10, col11, col12, col13, col14, col15, col16, col17, col18, col19. So row16: \"0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow17: 6 at col3, 7 at col4, 8 at col5, 9 at col6. So row17: 3 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col7, col8, col9, col10, col11, col12, col13, col14, col15, col16, col17, col18, col19. So row17: \"0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow18: 6 at col2, 7 at col3, 8 at col4, 9 at col5. So row18: 2 zeros, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col6, col7, col8, col9, col10, col11, col12, col13, col14, col15, col16, col17, col18, col19. So row18: \"0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow19: 6 at col1, 7 at col2, 8 at col3, 9 at col4. So row19: 1 zero, then 6,7,8,9, then zeros at col5, col6, col7, col8, col9, col10, col11, col12, col13, col14, col15, col16, col17, col18, col19. So row19: \"0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nLet's double-check each row has 20 numbers.\n\nRow0: 20 zeros. Yes.\n\nRow1: 19 zeros + 6 = 20 numbers. Yes.\n\nRow2: 18 zeros + 6 + 7 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow3: 17 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow4: 16 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow5: 15 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow6: 14 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow7: 13 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow8: 12 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow9: 11 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow10: 10 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow11: 9 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Wait 9 zeros + 4 numbers + 6 zeros = 19? Let's count: 9 zeros + 4 numbers = 13, plus 6 zeros = 19. Actually we need 20 numbers. Let's count row11 carefully: we have 9 zeros (indices 0-8). Then 6 at col9, 7 at col10, 8 at col11, 9 at col12. Then zeros at col13-19 (7 zeros). So total numbers: 9 zeros + 4 numbers + 7 zeros = 20. Yes, 9+4+7=20. So row11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow12: 8 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow13: 7 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow14: 6 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow15: 5 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow16: 4 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow17: 3 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow18: 2 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nRow19: 1 zero + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Yes.\n\nThus the grid is correct.\n\nBut we must ensure the pattern matches the earlier examples: In earlier examples, the input row's non-zero values appear in the same relative order in each row. Here we have 6,7,8,9 in that order. So each row has them in that order. Good.\n\nNow let's verify that we didn't misplace any zeros or values. Let's check a few rows against the rule: For row r, offset = 19 - r. The values should be at columns offset + 1, offset + 2, offset + 3, offset + 4 (since i=1..4). For r=0: offset=19. offset+1=20>19 out-of-bounds, so no values. For r=1: offset=18. offset+1=19 -> 6 at col19. offset+2=20 out-of-bounds. So row1: 6 at col19. Good. For r=2: offset=17. offset+1=18 -> 6 at col18. offset+2=19 -> 7 at col19. Good. For r=3: offset=16. offset+1=17 -> 6 at col17. offset+2=18 -> 7 at col18. offset+3=19 -> 8 at col19. Good. For r=4: offset=15. offset+1=16 -> 6 at col16. offset+2=17 -> 7 at col17. offset+3=18 -> 8 at col18. offset+4=19 -> 9 at col19. Good. For r=5: offset=14. offset+1=15 -> 6 at col15. offset+2=16 -> 7 at col16. offset+3=17 -> 8 at col17. offset+4=18 -> 9 at col18. Good. For r=6: offset=13. offset+1=14 -> 6 at col14. offset+2=15 -> 7 at col15. offset+3=16 -> 8 at col16. offset+4=17 -> 9 at col17. Good. For r=7: offset=12. offset+1=13 -> 6 at col13. offset+2=14 -> 7 at col14. offset+3=15 -> 8 at col15. offset+4=16 -> 9 at col16. Good. For r=8: offset=11. offset+1=12 -> 6 at col12. offset+2=13 -> 7 at col13. offset+3=14 -> 8 at col14. offset+4=15 -> 9 at col15. Good. For r=9: offset=10. offset+1=11 -> 6 at col11. offset+2=12 -> 7 at col12. offset+3=13 -> 8 at col13. offset+4=14 -> 9 at col14. Good. For r=10: offset=9. offset+1=10 -> 6 at col10. offset+2=11 -> 7 at col11. offset+3=12 -> 8 at col12. offset+4=13 -> 9 at col13. Good. For r=11: offset=8. offset+1=9 -> 6 at col9. offset+2=10 -> 7 at col10. offset+3=11 -> 8 at col11. offset+4=12 -> 9 at col12. Good. For r=12: offset=7. offset+1=8 -> 6 at col8. offset+2=9 -> 7 at col9. offset+3=10 -> 8 at col10. offset+4=11 -> 9 at col11. Good. For r=13: offset=6. offset+1=7 -> 6 at col7. offset+2=8 -> 7 at col8. offset+3=9 -> 8 at col9. offset+4=10 -> 9 at col10. Good. For r=14: offset=5. offset+1=6 -> 6 at col6. offset+2=7 -> 7 at col7. offset+3=8 -> 8 at col8. offset+4=9 -> 9 at col9. Good. For r=15: offset=4. offset+1=5 -> 6 at col5. offset+2=6 -> 7 at col6. offset+3=7 -> 8 at col7. offset+4=8 -> 9 at col8. Good. For r=16: offset=3. offset+1=4 -> 6 at col4. offset+2=5 -> 7 at col5. offset+3=6 -> 8 at col6. offset+4=7 -> 9 at col7. Good. For r=17: offset=2. offset+1=3 -> 6 at col3. offset+2=4 -> 7 at col4. offset+3=5 -> 8 at col5. offset+4=6 -> 9 at col6. Good. For r=18: offset=1. offset+1=2 -> 6 at col2. offset+2=3 -> 7 at col3. offset+3=4 -> 8 at col4. offset+4=5 -> 9 at col5. Good. For r=19: offset=0. offset+1=1 -> 6 at col1. offset+2=2 -> 7 at col2. offset+3=3 -> 8 at col3. offset+4=4 -> 9 at col4. Good.\n\nSo the grid is consistent.\n\nNow we should produce the output grid as a list of rows with spaces.\n\nThus the final output should be 20 lines, each with 20 numbers separated by spaces.\n\nLet's format each row exactly as we described.\n\nRow0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\"\n\nRow2: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7\"\n\nRow3: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8\"\n\nRow4: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9\"\n\nRow5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0\"\n\nRow6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0\"\n\nRow7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0\"\n\nRow8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow10: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow12: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow13: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow14: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow15: \"0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow16: \"0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow17: \"0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow18: \"0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nRow19: \"0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nWe should double-check row numbers: Row0 to Row19 inclusive. Let's check that each row has 20 numbers. We can count quickly.\n\nRow0: 20 zeros. Good.\n\nRow1: 19 zeros + 6 = 20. Good.\n\nRow2: 18 zeros + 6 + 7 = 20. Good.\n\nRow3: 17 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 = 20. Good.\n\nRow4: 16 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 20. Good.\n\nRow5: 15 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow6: 14 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow7: 13 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow8: 12 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow9: 11 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow10: 10 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow11: 9 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow12: 8 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow13: 7 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow14: 6 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow15: 5 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow16: 4 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow17: 3 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow18: 2 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nRow19: 1 zero + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20. Good.\n\nThus the grid is correct.\n\nBut we must confirm that the output grid matches the pattern of previous examples. Let's cross-check the pattern: In Example 1, the output grid is symmetrical around the main diagonal? Actually the pattern is that the input row is repeated along a diagonal from bottom-left to top-right. The values shift leftwards each row. The bottom row has the entire input row, the next row has the input row shifted one to the right, etc. The top row may have no values if the input row's non-zero values are too far to the right. In Example 2, the input row had only one non-zero at index 2. The bottom row had 2 at index 2. The row above had 2 at index 3, etc. The top row had 2 at index 4. So the pattern matches.\n\nIn Example 3, the input row had three non-zero values at indices 0,2,4. The bottom row had 4 at col0, 6 at col2, 8 at col4. The row above had 4 at col1, 6 at col3, 8 at col5. The row above had 4 at col2, 6 at col4, 8 at col6. So each row shifts right by one relative to the row below. The pattern continues until the top row where only the first element appears at col14. This matches the rule.\n\nThus the rule we derived is correct.\n\nNow let's double-check the test input: 0 6 7 8 9. Input row has 4 non-zero values at indices 1,2,3,4. So k=4. So output size 4*5 = 20. We already computed the grid.\n\nBut we must check if there's any nuance: In Example 5, the input row had only one non-zero at index 1. Output size 5. That matches the rule. In Example 4, the input row had 3 non-zero values at indices 1,3,4. Output size 15. That matches the rule. In Example 1, input row had 2 non-zero values at indices 0,2. Output size 10. That matches the rule.\n\nThus the rule is consistent across all examples.\n\nBut we need to double-check that the output grid is exactly as we computed. Let's test some more: For test input, we need to produce a 20x20 grid. But we need to ensure that we didn't misplace any values. Let's test a few random rows: Row5: we have 6 at col15, 7 at col16, 8 at col17, 9 at col18. That's consistent with offset=14, i=1->col=15, i=2->col=16, i=3->col=17, i=4->col=18. Yes. Row5: we wrote \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0\". Let's count: 15 zeros then 6,7,8,9,0. That is 15 zeros + 4 numbers + 1 zero = 20. Good. Row5: indices 0-14 zeros, 15:6, 16:7, 17:8, 18:9, 19:0. Good.\n\nNow we must produce the final answer: The output grid as a list of rows. We need to output exactly as the examples: Each row on a new line, numbers separated by spaces. The output grid should not have any extra spaces at the end of lines. But we can include spaces between numbers.\n\nLet's produce the final output as a block of lines:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWe should double-check that the number of rows is 20. Let's count:\n\n1: row0\n2: row1\n3: row2\n4: row3\n5: row4\n6: row5\n7: row6\n8: row7\n9: row8\n10: row9\n11: row10\n12: row11\n13: row12\n14: row13\n15: row14\n16: row15\n17: row16\n18: row17\n19: row18\n20: row19\n\nYes.\n\nNow we should verify that each row has exactly 20 numbers. Let's count for a few rows:\n\nRow0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 20 zeros. Good.\n\nRow1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\" -> 19 zeros + 6. Good.\n\nRow2: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7\" -> 18 zeros + 6 + 7. Good.\n\nRow3: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8\" -> 17 zeros + 6 + 7 + 8. Good.\n\nRow4: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9\" -> 16 zeros + 4 numbers. Good.\n\nRow5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0\" -> 15 zeros + 4 numbers + 1 zero. Good.\n\nRow6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0\" -> 14 zeros + 4 numbers + 2 zeros. Good.\n\nRow7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0\" -> 13 zeros + 4 numbers + 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0\" -> 12 zeros + 4 numbers + 4 zeros. Good.\n\nRow9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 11 zeros + 4 numbers + 5 zeros. Good.\n\nRow10: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 10 zeros + 4 numbers + 6 zeros. Good.\n\nRow11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 9 zeros + 4 numbers + 7 zeros. Good.\n\nRow12: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 8 zeros + 4 numbers + 8 zeros. Good.\n\nRow13: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 7 zeros + 4 numbers + 9 zeros. Good.\n\nRow14: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 6 zeros + 4 numbers + 10 zeros. Good.\n\nRow15: \"0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 5 zeros + 4 numbers + 11 zeros. Good.\n\nRow16: \"0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 4 zeros + 4 numbers + 12 zeros. Good.\n\nRow17: \"0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 3 zeros + 4 numbers + 13 zeros. Good.\n\nRow18: \"0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 2 zeros + 4 numbers + 14 zeros. Good.\n\nRow19: \"0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 1 zero + 4 numbers + 15 zeros. Good.\n\nThus the grid is correct.\n\nNow we need to output the grid as final answer. Let's produce the final answer accordingly.\n\nBut we should double-check if the rule might be slightly different: In Example 2, input: [0,0,2,0,0]. k=1. Output size 5. The pattern: bottom row row4: 2 at col2. Row3: 2 at col3. Row2: 2 at col4. Row1: all zeros. Row0: all zeros. That matches rule: offset = 4 - r. For r=4, offset=0: col=0+2=2. For r=3, offset=1: col=1+2=3. For r=2, offset=2: col=2+2=4. For r=1, offset=3: col=3+2=5 >4 out-of-bounds. So row1: no values. For r=0, offset=4: col=4+2=6 >4 out-of-bounds. So row0: no values. So yes.\n\nNow we should check Example 5: input: [0,4,0,0,0]. k=1. offset = 4 - r. For r=4: offset=0: col=0+1=1 -> 4 at col1. For r=3: offset=1: col=1+1=2 -> 4 at col2. For r=2: offset=2: col=2+1=3 -> 4 at col3. For r=1: offset=3: col=3+1=4 -> 4 at col4. For r=0: offset=4: col=4+1=5 >4 out-of-bounds. So row0: no values. That matches output.\n\nNow we should check Example 4: input: [0,9,0,8,4]. k=3. offset = 14 - r. For r=14: offset=0: col=0+1=1 -> 9 at col1, col=0+3=3 -> 8 at col3, col=0+4=4 -> 4 at col4. That matches bottom row row14: 0 9 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Yes. For r=13: offset=1: col=1+1=2 -> 9 at col2, col=1+3=4 -> 8 at col4, col=1+4=5 -> 4 at col5. That matches row13: 0 0 9 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Yes. For r=12: offset=2: col=2+1=3 -> 9 at col3, col=2+3=5 -> 8 at col5, col=2+4=6 -> 4 at col6. That matches row12: 0 0 0 9 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Yes. And so on. So rule holds.\n\nThus we are confident the rule is correct.\n\nNow we just need to output the final grid.\n\nDouble-check that we didn't mis-interpret the input format: The input grid is a 1x5 row. We need to produce output grid. In the examples, the input is a single row of 5 numbers. The output is a square grid of dimension k*N. So we produce the output accordingly.\n\nNow we should double-check that we didn't miscount k. Input: 0 6 7 8 9. Non-zero values: 6,7,8,9. That's 4. So k=4. So output grid size 4*5=20. Yes.\n\nNow we can produce the final answer as a block of 20 lines.\n\nBut we need to check if there might be any nuance: For Example 3, the input had 3 non-zero values at indices 0,2,4. The output grid had 15x15. In that output, the top row had only the last element at col14. But we might ask: Did we correctly handle the case where the input row's last element is at index 4? For row0, offset=14. For i=4, col=14+4=18 >14 out-of-bounds. So no values. That matches. So top row row0 had only the first element at col14. But that is index 0. That is consistent with offset+0=14. So the top row has the first element of the input row at the rightmost column. Good.\n\nThus the rule is consistent.\n\nNow we can output the final grid.\n\nBut we need to ensure we didn't misplace any values. Let's cross-check the pattern: In the output grid, the values should appear along a diagonal that goes from bottom-left to top-right. In our grid, the values appear in a diagonal shape: The first row (row0) has no values. The second row has 6 at col19. The third row has 6 at col18, 7 at col19. The fourth row has 6 at col17, 7 at col18, 8 at col19. So the diagonal of 6's goes from bottom-left to top-right: 6 at col0 row19, 6 at col1 row18, 6 at col2 row17, 6 at col3 row16, 6 at col4 row15, 6 at col5 row14, 6 at col6 row13, 6 at col7 row12, 6 at col8 row11, 6 at col9 row10, 6 at col10 row9, 6 at col11 row8, 6 at col12 row7, 6 at col13 row6, 6 at col14 row5, 6 at col15 row4, 6 at col16 row3, 6 at col17 row2, 6 at col18 row1? Wait row1 has 6 at col19. Actually the diagonal of 6's goes from bottom-left to top-right but with offset shift: 6 appears at col0 row19, col1 row18, col2 row17, col3 row16, col4 row15, col5 row14, col6 row13, col7 row12, col8 row11, col9 row10, col10 row9, col11 row8, col12 row7, col13 row6, col14 row5, col15 row4, col16 row3, col17 row2, col18 row1, col19 row0? Wait row0 has no 6. So the diagonal of 6's stops at row1 col18. Actually the diagonal of 6's goes from row19 col0 to row1 col18. So it's offset by one from the top-left corner. Similarly, the diagonal of 7's goes from row19 col1 to row0 col19? Let's check: 7 appears at col1 row19, col2 row18, col3 row17, col4 row16, col5 row15, col6 row14, col7 row13, col8 row12, col9 row11, col10 row10, col11 row9, col12 row8, col13 row7, col14 row6, col15 row5, col16 row4, col17 row3, col18 row2, col19 row1? Wait row1 has 7 at col19? Actually row1 has 6 at col19, no 7. So 7's diagonal goes from row19 col1 to row2 col18? Let's check: row2 has 7 at col19, but row2 has 7 at col19? Wait row2: 6 at col18, 7 at col19. So 7 appears at col19 in row2. So 7's diagonal goes from row19 col1 to row2 col19. That's a diagonal of slope -1. The diagonal of 8's goes from row19 col2 to row3 col19. The diagonal of 9's goes from row19 col3 to row4 col19. So the diagonals are offset. This matches the pattern: The input row's non-zero elements appear as diagonals starting at bottom-left at different columns.\n\nThus the grid is correct.\n\nNow we should produce the final answer. We'll output the grid as described.\n\nBut we need to consider: In the examples, the output grid is printed with each row on a new line, numbers separated by spaces. So we should output exactly that.\n\nThus final answer:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWe should also verify that the output grid is symmetrical? It doesn't need to be symmetrical.\n\nNow we need to consider if there might be any other rule: For instance, maybe the output grid is the input row rotated and mirrored? But the rule we derived is consistent with all examples. So we can be confident.\n\nBut we should also check if there's any nuance about the grid size being always a multiple of 5? It is: 5, 10, 15, 20. So the output size is always a multiple of 5. That matches our rule: size = k*N, where N=5. So it's always a multiple of 5. Good.\n\nNow we can produce the final answer. But before we finalize, we should double-check that the output grid we produced is exactly the same as the pattern we would get by sliding the input row across a 20x20 grid. Let's simulate the sliding approach for a few rows to confirm.\n\nWe'll use shift s from 0 to 19. For each shift s, row = 19 - s. Starting at col = s. For each index i in input row: col = s + i. If col < 20, place input[i]. Let's do for shift s=0: row=19, col=s=0. Place input[0] at col0? input[0] is 0, so no value. Place input[1] at col1=1: 6 at col1. Place input[2] at col2=2: 7 at col2. Place input[3] at col3=3: 8 at col3. Place input[4] at col4=4: 9 at col4. That matches row19: 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 ... Good.\n\nShift s=1: row=18, col=s=1. Place input[0] at col1: 0 no. input[1] at col2: 6 at col2. input[2] at col3: 7 at col3. input[3] at col4: 8 at col4. input[4] at col5: 9 at col5. That matches row18: 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 ... Good.\n\nShift s=2: row=17, col=2. Place input[0] at col2: 0. input[1] at col3: 6 at col3. input[2] at col4: 7 at col4. input[3] at col5: 8 at col5. input[4] at col6: 9 at col6. That matches row17: 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 ... Good.\n\nShift s=3: row=16, col=3. Place input[1] at col4: 6 at col4. input[2] at col5: 7 at col5. input[3] at col6: 8 at col6. input[4] at col7: 9 at col7. That matches row16: 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 ... Good.\n\nShift s=4: row=15, col=4. Place input[1] at col5: 6 at col5. input[2] at col6: 7 at col6. input[3] at col7: 8 at col7. input[4] at col8: 9 at col8. That matches row15: 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 ... Good.\n\nShift s=5: row=14, col=5. Place input[1] at col6: 6 at col6. input[2] at col7: 7 at col7. input[3] at col8: 8 at col8. input[4] at col9: 9 at col9. That matches row14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 ... Good.\n\nShift s=6: row=13, col=6. Place input[1] at col7: 6 at col7. input[2] at col8: 7 at col8. input[3] at col9: 8 at col9. input[4] at col10: 9 at col10. That matches row13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 ... Good.\n\nShift s=7: row=12, col=7. Place input[1] at col8: 6 at col8. input[2] at col9: 7 at col9. input[3] at col10: 8 at col10. input[4] at col11: 9 at col11. That matches row12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 ... Good.\n\nShift s=8: row=11, col=8. Place input[1] at col9: 6 at col9. input[2] at col10: 7 at col10. input[3] at col11: 8 at col11. input[4] at col12: 9 at col12. That matches row11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 ... Good.\n\nShift s=9: row=10, col=9. Place input[1] at col10: 6 at col10. input[2] at col11: 7 at col11. input[3] at col12: 8 at col12. input[4] at col13: 9 at col13. That matches row10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 ... Good.\n\nShift s=10: row=9, col=10. Place input[1] at col11: 6 at col11. input[2] at col12: 7 at col12. input[3] at col13: 8 at col13. input[4] at col14: 9 at col14. That matches row9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 ... Good.\n\nShift s=11: row=8, col=11. Place input[1] at col12: 6 at col12. input[2] at col13: 7 at col13. input[3] at col14: 8 at col14. input[4] at col15: 9 at col15. That matches row8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 ... Good.\n\nShift s=12: row=7, col=12. Place input[1] at col13: 6 at col13. input[2] at col14: 7 at col14. input[3] at col15: 8 at col15. input[4] at col16: 9 at col16. That matches row7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0. Good.\n\nShift s=13: row=6, col=13. Place input[1] at col14: 6 at col14. input[2] at col15: 7 at col15. input[3] at col16: 8 at col16. input[4] at col17: 9 at col17. That matches row6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0. Good.\n\nShift s=14: row=5, col=14. Place input[1] at col15: 6 at col15. input[2] at col16: 7 at col16. input[3] at col17: 8 at col17. input[4] at col18: 9 at col18. That matches row5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0. Good.\n\nShift s=15: row=4, col=15. Place input[1] at col16: 6 at col16. input[2] at col17: 7 at col17. input[3] at col18: 8 at col18. input[4] at col19: 9 at col19. That matches row4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9. Good.\n\nShift s=16: row=3, col=16. Place input[1] at col17: 6 at col17. input[2] at col18: 7 at col18. input[3] at col19: 8 at col19. That matches row3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8. Good.\n\nShift s=17: row=2, col=17. Place input[1] at col18: 6 at col18. input[2] at col19: 7 at col19. That matches row2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7. Good.\n\nShift s=18: row=1, col=18. Place input[1] at col19: 6 at col19. That matches row1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6. Good.\n\nShift s=19: row=0, col=19. Place input[1] at col20? Actually col=19+1=20 >19 out-of-bounds. So row0: no values. Good.\n\nThus the sliding approach matches the grid we produced. Good.\n\nThus the output is correct.\n\nNow we need to output the grid as final answer.\n\nBut we need to check if the output grid should be printed with each row on a new line, no trailing spaces. The examples show each row on a new line. So we should produce exactly that.\n\nThus final answer:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 7 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWe should check if the output grid matches the pattern of sliding the input row across the diagonal. Yes.\n\nNow we need to output this as the final answer.
