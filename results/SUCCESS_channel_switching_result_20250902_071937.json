    "0": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to solve ARC puzzle. We have two examples with input and output. Need to deduce transformation rule. Let's parse the patterns.\n\nExample 1: Input grid size? Let's count columns: 28 columns? Provided lines each 28 numbers. Example 1 input: first line 28 zeros. second line: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\" that's 28 entries. So grid 28x28.\n\nOutput grid same size 28x28. The transformation appears to replace some 1's with 8's? Let's examine: In input, there are many 1's forming shapes. In output, many of those 1's replaced by 8's in some pattern. Also some 1's remain. Let's analyze.\n\nLook at Example 1 output: The first row has a single 8 at column 16? Actually first row: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 8 at column 16 (index 15 zero-based). In input, first row all zeros. So 8 inserted. This indicates that 8's are inserted at positions that correspond to the shape of 1's maybe? Let's analyze shapes.\n\nIn input, there is a big shape of 1's forming a kind of vertical/horizontal lines? Let's examine input: The second line: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So there is a left block of 1's from columns 2-8 (positions 2-8 inclusive) and a right block of 1's from columns 19-26? Wait indices: Starting from 0: columns 2-8 inclusive 7 cells. Then columns 19-26 inclusive 8 cells. So two blocks.\n\nThird line: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. So 1's at columns 2,8,19,27. So vertical lines maybe.\n\nFourth line: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So 1's at columns 8,20.\n\nFifth line: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. So 1's at columns 2,8,20,27.\n\nSixth line: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So left block of 1's again 2-8, right block 20-26.\n\nSeventh line all zeros.\n\nEighth line: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So 1's at 12-14, 16-20? Actually 12-14 (positions 12-14) 1, 16-20 (positions 16-20) 1, but 15 is 0? Wait: indices: 0-11 zeros, 12 1, 13 1, 14 1, 15 0, 16 1, 17 1, 18 1, 19 1, 20 1, 21 0, rest zeros. So left block 12-14, right block 16-20.\n\nNinth line: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So 1 at 12 and 20.\n\nTenth line: same pattern.\n\nThe pattern seems to be a cross shape: vertical lines at columns 2,8,20,27? Wait 27 maybe? Let's analyze.\n\nPositions of 1's across rows:\n\nRow 2: columns 2-8 and 19-26? Wait earlier we said 19-26. Actually index 19? Let's recount: row 2 has 1's at columns 2-8 and 19-26? Wait row 2: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\". Counting: columns 0-1 zeros, columns 2-8 (seven 1's), columns 9-18 zeros, columns 19-26 (eight 1's), column 27 zero. So yes 19-26 inclusive.\n\nRow 3: 1's at columns 2,8,19,27. So vertical lines at columns 2,8,19,27.\n\nRow 4: 1's at columns 8,20.\n\nRow 5: 1's at columns 2,8,20,27.\n\nRow 6: 1's at columns 2-8 and 20-26.\n\nSo shape appears to be a 7x? pattern: maybe a cross with arms? Let's analyze more.\n\nFrom row 2 to row 6 we see a pattern: left vertical line at column 2, right vertical line at column 8? Wait column 8 is also a vertical line but maybe part of left block? Let's check: In row 2, left block includes column 8? Actually left block includes columns 2-8 inclusive, so includes column 8. In row 3, 1 at column 8, yes. In row 4, 1 at column 8, yes. In row 5, 1 at column 8, yes. In row 6, left block includes 2-8 inclusive, so column 8 is part of block. So left block is horizontal bar at row 2 and row 6, vertical bar at column 2 and 8 from rows 3-5? Actually vertical bar at column 2 from rows 3-5, vertical bar at column 8 from rows 3-5, plus maybe at row 4 column 20? Wait.\n\nSimilarly right block: columns 19-26 inclusive at row 2 and 6, vertical lines at columns 19,20,26? Let's examine: row 3 has 1 at 19 and 27. So vertical bar at column 19 and 27. Row 4 has 1 at 20. Row 5 has 1 at 20 and 27. Row 6 has block 20-26. So vertical bars at 20 and 27? Actually 27 is last column 27? Wait index 27 is last column; row 3 has 1 at 27, row 5 also 1 at 27, but row 4 doesn't? Row 4 has 1 at 20 only. Row 6 block includes 20-26, not 27. So 27 is not part of block? Wait row 6 has block 20-26 inclusive, so 27 is not 1. So 27 is only 1 at rows 3 and 5. So vertical bars at 27 maybe only at those rows? That seems weird.\n\nBut maybe the shape is a 7x7 block rotated? Let's analyze more.\n\nLet's examine Example 1 output. In output, the 8's appear to fill the interior of the shape? Let's see.\n\nOutput row 2: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So row 2 has 8 at column 15? Actually column 15 (index 15). Wait earlier we said column 15? Let's count: row 2: zeros 0-14? Let's count: columns 0-1 zeros, 2-8 ones, 9-14 zeros, column 15 8, 16-18 zeros, 19-26 ones, 27 zero. So 8 inserted at column 15.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0. So row 3 has 1 at col2, 1 at col8, 1 at col19, 1 at col27, and 8's at columns 3-7 (within left block interior), 15 (center), 20-25? Wait 20-25 are 8's, 26? Actually 26 is 1. So 8's fill interior of left block (columns 3-7) and interior of right block (20-25). Also 8 at column 15 (center). So the 8's appear inside the shape.\n\nRow 4: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8. So row 4 has 8's at columns 0-7 inclusive (left block interior plus maybe outer?), 1 at col8, 1 at col19, 8's at columns 20-27? Wait 20-27 inclusive? Actually 20-27 all 8's? Let's count: row 4: \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\". So 8's at columns 0-7 inclusive (eight cells). Column 8 is 1. Column 9-15 zeros. Column 16 is 8. Column 17-18 zeros. Column 19 is 1. Column 20-27 all 8's.\n\nThus 8's fill left block interior plus leftmost border? Wait left block originally 1's at columns 2-8 in row 2, but row 4 has 8's at columns 0-7, so includes columns 0-1 zeros originally. So 8's extended beyond original block. So maybe the 8's fill the bounding rectangle of the shape? Let's analyze bounding rectangle.\n\nIn input, the shape's 1's are in columns 2-8 and 19-26, rows 2-6. So bounding rectangle: rows 2-6 inclusive, columns 2-26 inclusive. But 8's appear also at columns 0-1? Wait row 4 has 8's at columns 0-1. That extends beyond bounding rectangle. So maybe 8's fill a larger rectangle that includes the shape plus some margin? Let's analyze pattern: The 8's appear to fill the entire area inside a rectangle that encloses the shape, but also maybe fill the area outside? Let's examine more rows.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0. So 8's at columns 3-7, 15, 20-25. Row 6: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So row 6 has 1's at columns 2-8 and 20-26, 8 at column 15. So the 8's appear only in interior columns 3-7 and 20-25, and column 15. The 8's also appear at column 15 in many rows. So 8's appear at central vertical line.\n\nAlso row 4 had 8's at columns 0-1 and 20-27. Wait row 4 had 8's at columns 0-1, 16, 20-27. That seems inconsistent with interior only. But maybe row 4 is special because left block vertical lines at columns 2-8? Actually row 4 had 1 at column 8 only. So the left block's horizontal bar at row 4? Wait left block's horizontal bar at row 4? Let's check input row 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So only 1 at column 8 and 20. So left block vertical lines at 8 and 20? Wait 20 is right block vertical line. So row 4 has no horizontal bars. So row 4 is a crossing point? Actually row 4 is the middle row of the shape: left block vertical line at column 8, right block vertical line at column 20. In output row 4, 8's at columns 0-7, 16, 20-27. So 8's fill the area between the vertical lines? Let's analyze: 8's at columns 0-7 (left of vertical line at 8), column 16 (between vertical lines at 8 and 20), columns 20-27 (right of vertical line at 20). So 8's fill everything except the two vertical lines at 8 and 20? Actually column 8 has 1, column 20 has 1. So 8's fill the rest of the row. So row 4 is fully filled with 8 except the two 1's. That suggests 8's fill the area outside the shape's 1's? But not outside; they fill the area inside the rectangle formed by the shape's outer boundaries, but excluding the 1's. But earlier row 4 had 8's at columns 0-1 which are outside the left block? Wait the rectangle's left boundary is column 2? Actually the shape's leftmost 1 is at column 2. But row 4 has 8 at column 0-1 which is left of column 2. So 8's extend beyond left boundary.\n\nLet's examine the bounding rectangle more carefully. In input, the shape's 1's are at columns 2-8 and 19-26. So leftmost column of 1's is 2, rightmost is 26. So bounding rectangle width 25? Actually 2-26 inclusive. The rectangle's leftmost column is 2. But 8's appear at column 0-1, which is outside. So 8's extend beyond the shape's bounding rectangle.\n\nMaybe the 8's fill the entire area of a larger shape formed by the 1's plus some margin? Let's analyze the pattern: In output, 8's appear in a large rectangle that includes the shape's bounding rectangle plus additional columns 0-1 and 20-27? Wait 20-27 includes 27 which is outside rightmost 1? Actually rightmost 1 is 26. So 27 is outside. So 8's extend beyond the shape's bounding rectangle on both sides. So maybe 8's fill the entire area of the shape's bounding rectangle plus some margin of 2 columns on each side? But we need to verify with other rows.\n\nRow 2 had 8 at column 15 (center) but no 8 at left side columns 0-1 or right side 20-27? Wait row 2 had 8 at column 15 only. So row 2 didn't fill left side or right side. So the margin idea may not hold.\n\nLet's analyze the shape more thoroughly. It might be a 3x3 pattern repeated? Actually the shape might be two 5x5 squares? Let's examine the shape: There are two large squares of 1's: left block 7x5? Actually left block has horizontal bars at rows 2 and 6 (top and bottom), vertical bars at rows 3-5 at columns 2 and 8. That forms a rectangle 5 rows tall (rows 2-6) and 7 columns wide (cols 2-8). Similarly right block: horizontal bars at rows 2 and 6, vertical bars at rows 3-5 at columns 19 and 27? Wait 27 is outside? Actually right block vertical bars at columns 19 and 27? But the horizontal bars at rows 2 and 6 are at columns 19-26. So vertical bars at 19 and 27? Wait 27 is outside the horizontal bar? Let's examine: In input, right block horizontal bars at row 2: columns 19-26. Row 6: same. In rows 3-5, there are 1's at columns 19 and 27? Row 3 has 1 at 19 and 27. Row 5 has 1 at 19 and 27. Row 4 has 1 at 20. So vertical bars at columns 19,20,27? Wait 20 is not at edges of horizontal bar? Actually horizontal bar at row 2 includes 19-26. So vertical bar at column 19 is left side of right block. Vertical bar at column 20 is inside the block? But row 4 has 1 at column 20, but not at column 27. So maybe right block is irregular: left side vertical at 19, right side vertical at 27? But horizontal bars only extend to 26. So there is a missing 1 at 27 on horizontal bars, but vertical bar at 27 extends to rows 3 and 5. So shape may be a rectangle 5x8 (rows 2-6, columns 19-26) but with a vertical bar at 27 at rows 3-5? That seems odd.\n\nLet's examine the right block more carefully. Let's map coordinates for right block: In input, we have:\n\nRow 2: 1's at 19-26 inclusive (8 cells).\nRow 3: 1 at 19 and 27.\nRow 4: 1 at 20.\nRow 5: 1 at 19 and 27.\nRow 6: 1's at 20-26 inclusive (7 cells). Wait row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\". Wait row 6 left block? Actually row 6 has 1's at 2-8 and 20-26. So right block horizontal bar at row 6 extends 20-26 inclusive. So vertical bars: column 19 appears in rows 2 and 3 and 5? Wait row 5 has 1 at 19 and 27. Row 4 has 1 at 20. So vertical bar at column 19 appears in rows 2,3,5 but not 4? Actually row 4 has 1 at 20, not 19. So vertical bar at 19 is not continuous.\n\nMaybe the shape is a 7x5 rectangle with a diagonal? Let's visualize.\n\nLet's write a grid of 0/1 for the left block first:\n\nRows 2-6, columns 2-8:\n\nRow 2: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 (7)\nRow 3: 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 (1 at left and right edges)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0? Wait row 4: 1 at column 8 only. So left side 0 at column 2? Actually row 4 has 1 at column 8 only. So left side 0. So row 4 has only right edge 1. Row 5: 1 at columns 2 and 8. Row 6: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.\n\nSo left block shape is like a rectangle with missing left vertical at row 4? Actually row 4 has no left vertical. So shape is like a rectangle with a missing left vertical at row 4. But maybe it's a shape of letter \"O\" but missing a side? Let's examine.\n\nRight block: columns 19-26:\n\nRow 2: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 3: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1? Actually row 3 has 1 at 19 and 27, but 27 is outside 19-26. So right block row 3: 1 at 19, 0 at 20-26, and maybe 1 at 27 outside block. So row 3 has 1 at 19 and 27.\nRow 4: 1 at 20 only.\nRow 5: 1 at 19 and 27.\nRow 6: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 at 20-26.\n\nSo right block shape is weird.\n\nLet's examine the entire shape: It might be two rectangles of 1's separated by a space? Actually there are two rectangles of 1's: left block and right block, each 5 rows tall. The left block is at columns 2-8, right block at columns 19-26. They are separated by a gap of 10 columns (9-18). There are also some 1's at column 27? Actually column 27 is outside the right block. Those 1's at column 27 might be part of a vertical line connecting to the right block? Let's see: column 27 has 1's at rows 3 and 5, but not at 2,4,6. So it's a vertical line of two cells. So maybe the shape is a \"U\" shape? Actually maybe the shape is a letter \"P\" or \"D\" shape?\n\nBut the output: 8's appear in the interior of the shape, plus some extra. Let's analyze the output more systematically.\n\nWe need to find a rule that transforms the input to output.\n\nObservations:\n\n- The color 1 remains in the same positions (except maybe some replaced by 8?). Let's check: In output, do any 1's change to 8? Let's examine: In output, the 1's that were originally 1 remain 1? Let's check some positions: Input row 2 col 2 is 1. Output row 2 col 2 is 1. Input row 2 col 8 is 1. Output row 2 col 8 is 1. Input row 2 col 19 is 1. Output row 2 col 19 is 1. Input row 2 col 26 is 1. Output row 2 col 26 is 1. So 1's remain 1.\n\n- Some 1's that were originally 1 remain 1, but some 1's maybe changed to 8? Let's check: Input row 3 col 19 is 1. Output row 3 col 19 is 8? Wait row 3 output: \"0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0\". So at col 19? Wait column indices: Let's index row 3: 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0. So col 19 is 1? Wait we need to count: columns 0-1 zeros, 2 is 1, 3-7 are 8's, 8 is 1, 9-14 zeros, 15 is 8, 16-18 zeros, 19 is 1, 20-25 8's, 26 is 1, 27 is 0. So at col 19, there is 1. So 1 remained 1. So all original 1's remain 1.\n\n- Some 1's are replaced by 8? Let's check if any 1's changed to 8: For example, input row 3 col 19 is 1, remains 1. Input row 3 col 27 is 1, remains 1. Input row 4 col 8 is 1, remains 1. Input row 4 col 20 is 1, remains 1. Input row 5 col 19 is 1, remains 1. Input row 5 col 27 is 1, remains 1. Input row 6 col 2-8 are 1, remains 1. Input row 6 col 20-26 are 1, remains 1. So no 1's changed to 8.\n\n- 8's appear at many positions where input had 0. So 8's are inserted.\n\n- The 8's form a shape: In output, 8's fill the interior of the shape defined by the 1's? Let's examine: The 8's appear to fill a region inside the rectangle that encloses the 1's. But there is also 8's at column 15 (center) and at column 16 in row 4. Wait column 15 appears in many rows: row 2 col 15 is 8, row 3 col 15 is 8, row 4 col 15 is 8? Actually row 4 col 15 is 8? Wait row 4 output: \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\". So col 15 is 8. Row 5 col 15 is 8. Row 6 col 15 is 8. So column 15 is a vertical line of 8's across rows 2-6. Similarly column 16? Wait row 4 col 16 is 0? Actually row 4 col 16 is 0? Wait row 4 output: \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\". So column 16 is 0? Wait we need to index properly: Row 4: columns 0-7 are 8, col 8 is 1, col 9-14 zeros, col 15 is 8, col 16-18 zeros, col 19 is 1, col 20-27 are 8. So column 16 is 0. So column 16 is not 8. So the vertical line of 8's is at column 15, not 16.\n\nThus 8's form a vertical line at column 15 across rows 2-6. Also there is a horizontal line of 8's at row 4 across columns 0-7 and 20-27? Actually row 4 has 8's at columns 0-7, 15, 20-27. So horizontal line at row 4 across columns 0-7, 15, 20-27. But the 8's at 0-7 and 20-27 extend beyond the shape. So maybe the 8's fill a rectangle defined by the outermost 1's plus some margin? Let's compute bounding rectangle of 1's: leftmost 1 column = 2, rightmost 1 column = 27? Wait column 27 has 1 at rows 3 and 5. So rightmost 1 column is 27. So bounding rectangle width is 26? Actually 27-2+1 = 26. Height: topmost 1 row = 2, bottommost 1 row = 6. So bounding rectangle is rows 2-6 inclusive (height 5) and columns 2-27 inclusive (width 26). In output, 8's appear at column 0-1 (outside left margin) and 20-27 (some inside but also at 27). So 8's appear at columns 0-1, 20-27. So the 8's fill the area outside the leftmost 1? Actually leftmost 1 column is 2, but 8's fill 0-1, which are outside. So maybe 8's fill the area to the left of the shape's leftmost vertical line? But row 4 has 8's at 0-7 (which includes columns 0-1 outside leftmost 1). So 8's fill the area left of the shape's leftmost vertical line at column 8? Wait leftmost vertical line at column 8? Let's check: In left block, the vertical lines are at columns 2 and 8? Actually left block vertical lines at columns 2 and 8? Let's examine: In input, left block vertical lines: column 2 appears at rows 2-6? Actually row 2 has 1 at 2, row 3 has 1 at 2, row 4 has 1 at 2? Wait row 4 has 0 at 2. Row 5 has 1 at 2, row 6 has 1 at 2. So vertical line at column 2 is present at rows 2,3,5,6 but missing at row 4. So not continuous. Column 8 appears at rows 2-6? Row 2 has 1 at 8, row 3 has 1 at 8, row 4 has 1 at 8, row 5 has 1 at 8, row 6 has 1 at 8. So vertical line at column 8 is continuous.\n\nThus left block vertical line at column 8 is continuous. So 8's appear at column 15, which is between 8 and 20? Wait 20 is right block vertical line at column 20? Actually right block vertical lines at columns 20 and 27? Wait right block vertical lines: column 20 appears at rows 2-6? Row 2 has 1 at 20, row 3 has 1 at 20? Actually row 3 has 1 at 20? Wait row 3 input: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. So row 3 has 1 at column 19 and 27. So 20 is 0. So vertical line at 20 is not continuous. Row 4 has 1 at 20. Row 5 has 1 at 20? Row 5 input: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. So 1 at 20? Wait row 5 has 1 at 19 and 27. So 20 is 0. Row 6 has 1 at 20. So vertical line at 20 appears only at rows 2,4,6? Wait row 2 has 1 at 20, row 4 has 1 at 20, row 6 has 1 at 20. So vertical line at 20 is at rows 2,4,6. So not continuous.\n\nThus the shape is not a rectangle but more irregular.\n\nLet's analyze the shape as two separate shapes: left shape (a 5x7 rectangle with a missing left side at row 4) and right shape (a 5x8 rectangle with a missing right side at row 4 maybe?). But maybe it's two shapes that are symmetrical across the center? Actually left shape symmetrical? Let's examine left shape: It has vertical line at column 8 continuous, horizontal lines at row 2 and 6. So it's like a rectangle missing left side at row 4. Right shape: vertical line at column 20 continuous? Wait right shape vertical line at column 20 appears at rows 2,4,6. So not continuous. But vertical line at column 27 appears at rows 3,5. So shape is irregular.\n\nBut the output 8's appear to fill the interior of these shapes: For left shape, the interior would be columns 3-7 between vertical line at 2 and 8? But there is no vertical line at 2? Actually vertical line at 2 is missing at row 4. But interior of shape might be columns 3-7 between 2 and 8. In output, we see 8's at columns 3-7 in rows 2-6? Let's check: Row 2: 8's at columns 3-7? Actually row 2 output: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. So row 2 has 8 at column 15 only, not at columns 3-7. So interior of left shape is not filled at row 2. But row 3: 8's at columns 3-7. So interior is filled at row 3. Row 4: interior 8's at columns 0-7? Wait row 4 has 8's at 0-7. So interior of left shape is columns 3-7, but row 4 has 8's at 0-7, including left side outside shape. So not consistent.\n\nThus maybe the 8's fill a larger shape that is the union of the two shapes? Let's examine the shape of 8's: In output, 8's appear at many positions that form a rectangle from row 2 to row 6, columns 0-1, 15, 20-27, plus 3-7 and 20-25. Let's map all 8's:\n\nRow 2: col 15.\nRow 3: col 3-7, 15, 20-25.\nRow 4: col 0-7, 15, 20-27.\nRow 5: col 3-7, 15, 20-25.\nRow 6: col 15.\n\nSo 8's form a shape that looks like a \"U\" or something? Let's draw approximate shape:\n\nRows 2-6, columns 0-27. Mark 8's:\n\nRow 2: .................. 8 ...................\nRow 3: ....... 8 8 8 8 8 .... 8 8 8 8 8 8 ...\nRow 4: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 ................ 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nRow 5: ....... 8 8 8 8 8 .... 8 8 8 8 8 8 ...\nRow 6: .................. 8 ...................\n\nSo 8's form a vertical line at column 15, and horizontal lines at row 4 across columns 0-7 and 20-27. Also interior horizontal lines at row 3 and 5 across columns 3-7 and 20-25. So 8's form a shape that is basically a rectangle with a vertical line at center and horizontal lines at top and bottom? Actually row 3 and 5 horizontal lines at columns 3-7 and 20-25, not at 0-1 or 20-27. So maybe the shape is a \"cross\" shape: vertical line at 15 across all rows, horizontal line at row 4 across all columns, plus two extra horizontal lines at row 3 and 5 across the interior of left and right shapes. But row 4 horizontal line extends across entire width (0-7 and 20-27). But there is a gap between 8-19? Actually row 4 horizontal line includes columns 0-7 and 20-27, but not 8-19. But there are 1's at columns 8 and 20. So horizontal line at row 4 has 1's at 8 and 20, but 8's at 0-7 and 20-27. So horizontal line at row 4 is basically the union of two segments: 0-7 and 20-27. So 8's at row 4 fill the entire row except the 1's at columns 8 and 20. So basically 8's fill the row 4 except where there are 1's.\n\nThus 8's fill the area that is not 1's but within some bounding area? Let's consider bounding area: The bounding rectangle of all 1's is rows 2-6, columns 2-27. 8's appear in that rectangle except at positions of 1's? Let's check: For each row 2-6, columns 2-27, is every position either 1 or 8? Let's test:\n\nRow 2: columns 2-27: 1 at 2-8, 0 at 9-14, 8 at 15, 0 at 16-18, 1 at 19-26. So not all positions are 1 or 8; there are zeros at 9-14, 16-18. So 8's do not fill all zeros within bounding rectangle. So maybe 8's fill the area that is inside a shape defined by 1's? For left shape, interior is columns 3-7 and rows 3-5. For right shape, interior is columns 20-25 and rows 3-5. But 8's also fill the vertical line at column 15 across all rows 2-6. So 8's fill the interior of the shape plus a central vertical line connecting them.\n\nThus maybe the rule: For each shape (connected component of 1's), fill its interior with 8's. But also fill the central vertical line connecting the shapes? But that might be part of the interior of the union shape? Let's examine the shapes: The left shape and right shape are separated by a gap. But the union of shapes might be considered one shape? Actually there are two separate connected components of 1's. But 8's fill interior of each component? Let's examine left shape: Its interior would be the cells inside the rectangle formed by its 1's. But left shape is not a closed rectangle; it has missing left vertical at row 4. So interior might be ambiguous.\n\nBut maybe the shape is a \"C\" shape: left block forms a \"C\" shape: vertical line at 8, horizontal lines at 2 and 6, vertical line at 2 missing at row 4, so shape looks like a \"C\" open on left side. The interior of the \"C\" shape would be the cells inside the \"C\" shape: columns 3-7 and rows 3-5. But 8's fill those cells: row 3 col 3-7, row 4 col 3-7? Wait row 4 col 3-7 are 8's? Row 4 col 3-7 are 8's indeed. Row 5 col 3-7 are 8's. So yes, interior of left \"C\" shape is filled with 8's.\n\nSimilarly right shape might be a \"C\" shape open on right side? Let's examine: Right shape: vertical line at 19? Actually vertical line at 27? Wait shape open on right side: vertical line at 19, horizontal lines at 2 and 6, vertical line at 27 missing at row 4? Actually right shape might be a \"C\" shape open on right side: left vertical at 19, horizontal at 2 and 6, right vertical at 27 missing at row 4. Let's check: Right shape vertical at 27 appears at rows 3 and 5, but missing at row 2 and 6? Actually row 2 has 0 at 27, row 6 has 0 at 27. So vertical at 27 missing at top and bottom? Wait top horizontal at row 2 includes 19-26, not 27. So 27 is outside the horizontal bars. So right shape may be a \"C\" shape open on right side: left vertical at 19, horizontal bars at 2 and 6, right vertical at 27 missing at row 4? But row 4 has 1 at 20, not 27. So shape open on right side.\n\nThus interior of right shape would be columns 20-25 and rows 3-5. Indeed 8's fill those cells: row 3 col 20-25 are 8's, row 4 col 20-25? Wait row 4 col 20-25 are 8's? Row 4 col 20-27 are 8's. So yes, interior of right shape is filled with 8's.\n\nThus the rule: For each \"C\" shaped component of 1's (or any shape that has an interior area), fill the interior with 8's. But what about the central vertical line at column 15? That might be the intersection of the two shapes? Wait column 15 is between left and right shapes. But column 15 is not part of any shape. But 8's appear at column 15 across all rows 2-6. Why? Maybe because the 8's fill the area that is not part of the shape but is inside the bounding rectangle of the shape? But interior of the shape defined by 1's includes column 15? Wait left shape interior is columns 3-7 and rows 3-5. Right shape interior is columns 20-25 and rows 3-5. So column 15 is not interior of either shape. So why 8 at column 15? Maybe because 8's fill the \"hole\" that remains between shapes? Actually the shapes might be considered a single shape with a hole: the union of the two shapes might create a shape with a hole in the middle? But the shapes are separate, not connected. But maybe the rule is: For each connected component of 1's, fill the interior of that component with 8's. But also fill the area that is between components if they are symmetrical? Let's analyze example 2 to see if similar pattern.\n\nExample 2: Input grid 27x27? Actually the grid has 27 columns? Let's check: The first line: 27 zeros? Actually the first line: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". That's 27 zeros. So grid 27x27.\n\nOutput grid: also 27x27.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern in example 2. Input: There is a shape of 1's. Let's examine. The shape appears to be a \"C\" shape or \"U\" shape? Let's analyze the coordinates.\n\nInput lines:\n\nLine 0: all zeros.\n\nLine 1: \"0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\". So 1's at columns 1-6 and 15-22? Actually 15-22 inclusive? Let's count: indices: 0 zero, 1-6 1's, 7-14 zeros, 15-22 1's, 23-24 zeros, 25-26 zeros? Wait 27 columns, indices 0-26. So 1's at 1-6, 15-22. So two blocks separated by gap of 8 columns.\n\nLine 2: \"0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\". So 1's at 1,6,15,22. So vertical lines at 1 and 6? Actually 1 and 6 are vertical lines of left block. 15 and 22 are vertical lines of right block. So shape is two \"C\" shapes? Let's analyze.\n\nLine 3: same as line 2: 1's at 1,6,15,22.\n\nLine 4: same.\n\nLine 5: \"0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\". So 1's at 1,6,15-22? Actually 15-22 inclusive 8 cells. So top horizontal bar at 15-22.\n\nLine 6: \"0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1's at 1-6. So left block bottom horizontal bar.\n\nLine 7-... lines 7-14: zeros.\n\nLine 15: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1's at 2-9? Wait indices: 0-1 zeros, 2-9 1's, 10-24 zeros, 25-26 zeros. So left block bottom horizontal bar maybe? Actually left block bottom horizontal bar at row 15? Wait left block bottom horizontal bar originally at row 6. But here we see a horizontal bar at row 15 from 2-9. That might be a new shape? Let's examine.\n\nLine 16: \"0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So output row 16 shows 8's inserted. So input row 16: \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So input row 16: 1's at 2,9,15-20? Actually 15-20 inclusive? Let's count: indices: 0-1 zeros, 2 1, 3-8 zeros, 9 1, 10-14 zeros, 15-20 1's, 21-23 zeros, 24-26 zeros. So 1's at 2,9,15-20. Output row 16: 1 at 2, 1 at 9, 1 at 15, 1 at 20? Actually output row 16: \"0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So 1's at 2,9,15,20? Wait 15-20 inclusive 1's? Actually output row 16: after 15, there is 0? Let's parse: 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So indices: 0 0, 1 0, 2 1, 3 8, 4 8, 5 8, 6 8, 7 8, 8 8, 9 1, 10 0, 11 0, 12 0, 13 0, 14 0, 15 0, 16 1, 17 1, 18 1, 19 1, 20 1, 21 1, 22 0, 23 0, 24 0. So 1's at 2,9,16-21? Actually 16-21 inclusive. So 1's at 16-21. Wait earlier we had 1's at 15-20. So output moved them to 16-21? But no, 1's at 15-20 replaced by 8's at 15-20? Actually 1's at 15-20 replaced by 8's? Let's check: Input row 16 had 1's at 15-20. Output row 16 has 1's at 16-21. So the 1's at 15-20 moved to 16-21? Wait no, maybe we mis-index. Let's re-evaluate.\n\nBetter to map indices for row 16 input and output:\n\nInput row 16: \"0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\"\n\nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:1,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:1,17:1,18:1,19:1,20:1,21:1,22:0,23:0,24:0.\n\nSo 1's at 2,9,16-21. Output row 16: \"0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\"\n\nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:1,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:1,17:1,18:1,19:1,20:1,21:1,22:0,23:0,24:0.\n\nSo 1's at 2,9,16-21. So the 1's at 16-21 remain same. So no shift. The 1's at 15-20 in input are 1's at 16-21? Wait input had 1's at 16-21; output has 1's at 16-21. So no shift. So output row 16 is same as input except that the 1's at positions 3-8 are replaced by 8's. Wait input had zeros at 3-8. Output has 8's at 3-8. So 8's inserted at positions 3-8.\n\nThus 8's inserted at interior of left shape? Let's analyze shapes.\n\nInput: There is a left block: top horizontal bar at row 1: columns 1-6. Bottom horizontal bar at row 6: columns 1-6. Vertical bars at columns 1 and 6: rows 1-6. That forms a rectangle shape. The interior of this rectangle is rows 2-5, columns 2-5. In input, those interior cells are zeros. In output, those interior cells become 8's? Let's check: Output row 2: row 2 has 8 at columns 2-5? Actually output row 2: \"0 1 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0\". So row 2: 1 at column 1, 8's at 2-5, 1 at 6, zeros elsewhere until 15, 1 at 15? Wait 15 is 1? Actually 15 is 0? Let's parse: indices: 0:0,1:1,2:8,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:1,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:1,16:8,17:8,18:8,19:8,20:8,21:8,22:1,23:0,24:0. So row 2: 8's at 2-5 (inside left block) and 8's at 16-21 (inside right block). So yes, 8's inserted inside both blocks.\n\nThus rule: For each rectangle of 1's, fill the interior with 8's. That seems to match left block. But we also need to check the right block: The right block is also a rectangle: top horizontal bar at row 1: columns 15-22, bottom horizontal bar at row 5: columns 15-22, vertical bars at columns 15 and 22: rows 1-5. So interior rows 2-4, columns 16-21. In input, interior cells at those coordinates are zeros. In output, those cells become 8's. Let's check: Output row 2 has 8's at 16-21. Row 3 has 8's at 16-21. Row 4 has 8's at 16-21. Row 5 has 8's at 16-21. Yes.\n\nThus the rule: For each rectangular shape of 1's, fill interior with 8's.\n\nBut what about shapes that are not rectangles? In Example 1, the shapes are not perfect rectangles: left shape has missing left side at row 4, right shape missing right side at row 4. But they are still \"C\" shapes that have an interior. But the interior of a C shape might be defined as the cells that are bounded by the shape? For a C shape, the interior is not fully enclosed; there is a hole open at one side. But the interior might still be defined as the cells that are inside the shape's bounding rectangle but not part of shape? But there is an opening, so interior might be ambiguous. However, the 8's appear to fill the interior of both shapes: For left shape, interior cells are at rows 3-5, columns 3-7. These are indeed 8's. For right shape, interior cells are at rows 3-5, columns 20-25. These are 8's. So interior is defined as the cells that are surrounded by the shape's edges (i.e., cells that are not part of shape but are inside the bounding rectangle of shape). But due to the shape being open on one side, some cells might be considered interior but not fully enclosed by edges. But the rule seems to treat the shape as a rectangle with missing side, but still interior cells are defined as those inside the bounding rectangle of the shape that are not part of the shape. For left shape, bounding rectangle: rows 2-6, columns 2-8. The cells inside that rectangle but not part of shape are: rows 3-5, columns 3-7. Yes. For right shape, bounding rectangle: rows 2-6, columns 19-27? Actually right shape bounding rectangle: columns 19-27 inclusive? Because 27 is the rightmost 1. So rectangle rows 2-6, columns 19-27. The cells inside that rectangle but not part of shape: rows 3-5, columns 20-26? Wait 27 is rightmost column, but 27 is part of shape only at rows 3 and 5. So bounding rectangle includes column 27. But interior cells would be rows 3-5, columns 20-26. But some of these cells are part of shape? Let's check: For right shape, the vertical bar at column 27 is missing at rows 2 and 6. So interior cells at rows 3-5, columns 20-26: Are any of those part of shape? At row 3, columns 20-26: 0? Row 3 input: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. So at row 3, columns 20-26: 0 at 20-26? Actually 20-26 includes 20,21,22,23,24,25,26. Row 3 input: column 20 is 0, 21 0, 22 0, 23 0, 24 0, 25 0, 26 0. So all zeros. At row 4: input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So columns 20-26 zeros. Row 5: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. So columns 20-26 zeros. So interior cells for right shape are indeed zeros. So 8's fill them.\n\nThus the rule: For each rectangular shape of 1's, fill interior with 8's. But we must also consider shapes that are not perfect rectangles but still have interior cells? Example 1 shapes are \"C\" shapes, but they still have interior cells that are inside bounding rectangle but not part of shape. So the rule might be: For each connected component of 1's that forms a rectangular outline (i.e., has at most 2 vertical sides and 2 horizontal sides), fill interior cells with 8. But maybe the rule is simpler: For each connected component of 1's, find the minimal bounding rectangle of that component. Then fill all cells inside that rectangle that are not part of the component with 8. That would fill interior cells, even if shape is not closed. That seems to produce the 8's we see. Let's test this rule on Example 1: For left shape, bounding rectangle is rows 2-6, columns 2-8. Fill interior cells (rows 3-5, columns 3-7) with 8. That matches. For right shape, bounding rectangle is rows 2-6, columns 19-27. Fill interior cells (rows 3-5, columns 20-26) with 8. That matches. But we also see 8 at column 15, which is not inside bounding rectangle of any shape. So maybe there is a third component? Actually column 15 has 0's in input, but there might be a shape of 0's? But we only fill interior of 1's components. So column 15 should not be filled. But it is. So maybe there is a third component: The 1's at column 15? Wait input at column 15: Row 2: 0, row 3: 0, row 4: 0, row 5: 0, row 6: 0. So no 1's at column 15. So no component. So why 8's at column 15? Wait maybe we mis-identified 8's at column 15? Let's double-check: In output row 2, we saw 8 at column 15. In output row 3, 8 at column 15. In output row 4, 8 at column 15. In output row 5, 8 at column 15. In output row 6, 8 at column 15. So column 15 across rows 2-6 is 8. So 8's appear at column 15, but there is no 1's there. So why? Maybe the rule is: For each shape of 1's, fill interior cells with 8, but also fill the central vertical line that connects the two shapes? But that seems unnatural.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we mis-read the output: The 8's at column 15 might not be at column 15 but at column 16? Let's double-check the output for row 2: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\". Let's index: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1,7:1,8:1,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:8,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:1,20:1,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:1,27:0. So 8 at column 15. Good. Row 3: \"0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0\". Let's index: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:1,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:8,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:1,20:8,21:8,22:8,23:8,24:8,25:8,26:1,27:0. So 8 at column 15 again. Row 4: \"8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\". Index: 0:8,1:8,2:8,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:1,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:8,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:1,20:8,21:8,22:8,23:8,24:8,25:8,26:8,27:8. So 8 at column 15 again. Row 5: \"0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0\". Index: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:1,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:8,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:1,20:8,21:8,22:8,23:8,24:8,25:8,26:1,27:0. So 8 at column 15 again. Row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\". Index: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1,7:1,8:1,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:8,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:1,20:1,21:1,22:1,23:1,24:1,25:1,26:1,27:0. So 8 at column 15 again.\n\nThus column 15 is indeed filled with 8 across all rows 2-6. So why? Maybe the shape at column 15 is the interior of a shape that is formed by the union of the left and right shapes? Let's consider the union of left and right shapes: They are separated by a gap of columns 9-18 (10 columns). The bounding rectangle of the union is rows 2-6, columns 2-27. The interior of that rectangle includes all cells inside that rectangle that are not part of the shape. That includes cells in the gap (columns 9-18). But the interior cells in the gap might be considered interior of the shape? But the shape is not closed; there is a gap. So maybe the rule is: For each connected component of 1's, fill interior cells with 8. Additionally, for each pair of components that are symmetric or mirrored across the center, fill the vertical line connecting them? But that seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8's fill all cells that are at the same row as the shape's top or bottom border but not part of shape? Wait row 4 is the middle row; 8's fill entire row except for the 1's at columns 8 and 20. So row 4 has 8's at all columns except 8 and 20. That seems like the rule: For each row that is the middle row of the shape (i.e., the row between the top and bottom horizontal bars), fill all cells between the two vertical bars with 8. But left shape vertical bars at columns 2 and 8? But left shape vertical bars at columns 2 and 8, but row 4 has 1 at column 8 only. So the vertical bars are not symmetrical. But row 4 has 8 at columns 0-7 and 20-27. So 8's fill everything left of column 8 (except column 8) and right of column 20 (except column 20). That seems like 8's fill the entire row except the 1's at columns 8 and 20. So maybe the rule: For each row that contains a 1 at the left side of a shape, fill all cells to the left of that 1 with 8? But not exactly.\n\nLet's analyze the shape of 1's in example 1 more thoroughly. We'll create a map of 1's:\n\nCoordinates (row, col) of 1's:\n\nRow 2: (2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8),(2,19),(2,20),(2,21),(2,22),(2,23),(2,24),(2,25),(2,26)\nRow 3: (3,2),(3,8),(3,19),(3,27)\nRow 4: (4,8),(4,20)\nRow 5: (5,2),(5,8),(5,20),(5,27)\nRow 6: (6,2),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8),(6,20),(6,21),(6,22),(6,23),(6,24),(6,25),(6,26)\nRow 7: none\nRow 8: (8,12),(8,13),(8,14),(8,16),(8,17),(8,18),(8,19),(8,20),(8,21),(8,22),(8,23),(8,24),(8,25),(8,26)\nRow 9: (9,12),(9,20)\nRow 10: (10,12),(10,20)\nRow 11: (11,12),(11,20)\nRow 12: (12,12),(12,20)\nRow 13: (13,12),(13,13),(13,14),(13,15),(13,16),(13,17),(13,18),(13,19),(13,20),(13,21),(13,22),(13,23),(13,24),(13,25),(13,26),(13,27)\nRow 14: (14,5),(14,6),(14,7),(14,8),(14,9),(14,10)\nRow 15: (15,5),(15,6),(15,7),(15,8),(15,9),(15,10),(15,11),(15,12),(15,13),(15,14),(15,15),(15,16),(15,17),(15,18),(15,19),(15,20),(15,21),(15,22),(15,23),(15,24),(15,25),(15,26),(15,27)\nRow 16: (16,5),(16,6),(16,7),(16,8),(16,9),(16,10),(16,11),(16,12),(16,13),(16,14),(16,15),(16,16),(16,17),(16,18),(16,19),(16,20),(16,21),(16,22),(16,23),(16,24),(16,25),(16,26),(16,27)\nRow 17: (17,5),(17,6),(17,7),(17,8),(17,9),(17,10),(17,11),(17,12),(17,13),(17,14),(17,15),(17,16),(17,17),(17,18),(17,19),(17,20),(17,21),(17,22),(17,23),(17,24),(17,25),(17,26),(17,27)\nRow 18: (18,5),(18,6),(18,7),(18,8),(18,9),(18,10),(18,11),(18,12),(18,13),(18,14),(18,15),(18,16),(18,17),(18,18),(18,19),(18,20),(18,21),(18,22),(18,23),(18,24),(18,25),(18,26),(18,27)\nRow 19: (19,5),(19,6),(19,7),(19,8),(19,9),(19,10),(19,11),(19,12),(19,13),(19,14),(19,15),(19,16),(19,17),(19,18),(19,19),(19,20),(19,21),(19,22),(19,23),(19,24),(19,25),(19,26),(19,27)\nRow 20: (20,5),(20,6),(20,7),(20,8),(20,9),(20,10),(20,11),(20,12),(20,13),(20,14),(20,15),(20,16),(20,17),(20,18),(20,19),(20,20),(20,21),(20,22),(20,23),(20,24),(20,25),(20,26),(20,27)\nRow 21: (21,5),(21,6),(21,7),(21,8),(21,9),(21,10),(21,11),(21,12),(21,13),(21,14),(21,15),(21,16),(21,17),(21,18),(21,19),(21,20),(21,21),(21,22),(21,23),(21,24),(21,25),(21,26),(21,27)\nRow 22: (22,5),(22,6),(22,7),(22,8),(22,9),(22,10),(22,11),(22,12),(22,13),(22,14),(22,15),(22,16),(22,17),(22,18),(22,19),(22,20),(22,21),(22,22),(22,23),(22,24),(22,25),(22,26),(22,27)\nRow 23: none\nRow 24: none\nRow 25: none\nRow 26: none\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up Example 1 and Example 2. The above list of coordinates seems to be from Example 2? Actually the coordinates above correspond to Example 2 input lines 15-22 etc. But we are analyzing Example 1. Let's step back. Example 1 input lines after line 8 maybe have some shapes of 1's at columns 12-14 etc. But the above coordinates are for Example 2? Let's re-check: The earlier coordinates were from Example 2, not Example 1. So we need to analyze Example 1 again.\n\nExample 1 input lines after line 7: There is a block at row 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1's at columns 12-14 and 16-20? Wait 12-14 inclusive, 16-20 inclusive? Actually 12-14: 1, 15:0, 16-20: 1's? Let's check: indices: 0-11 zeros, 12 1, 13 1, 14 1, 15 0, 16 1, 17 1, 18 1, 19 1, 20 1, 21 0, 22-27 zeros. So left block at row 8: columns 12-14 and 16-20? But 12-14 and 16-20? Actually 16-20 inclusive: 16,17,18,19,20. So 5 cells. So shape at row 8: left block of 1's at columns 12-14 and right block at columns 16-20. So there is a gap at column 15. So left block and right block separated by a column.\n\nRow 9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1's at 12 and 20.\n\nRow 10: same as row 9.\n\nRow 11: same.\n\nRow 12: same.\n\nRow 13: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1's at columns 12-20 inclusive? Actually 12-20 inclusive: 12-20: 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. So 9 cells. So row 13 has a continuous block from 12-20.\n\nRow 14: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1's at columns 5-10.\n\nRow 15: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1's at 5,9.\n\nRow 16: same as row 15.\n\nRow 17: same.\n\nRow 18: same.\n\nRow 19: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So 1's at 5,9,19-24? Actually 19-24 inclusive: 19,20,21,22,23,24. So 6 cells.\n\nRow 20: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\". So 1's at 5,9,19,24.\n\nRow 21: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\". So 1's at 5-9 and 19,24.\n\nRow 22: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\". So 1's at 19,24.\n\nRow 23: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So 1's at 19-24.\n\nRow 24: all zeros.\n\nRow 25: all zeros.\n\nSo Example 1 input has multiple shapes: The top-left shape (rows 2-6, columns 2-8) and the top-right shape (rows 2-6, columns 19-26). Then there's a lower shape (rows 8-13, columns 12-20) and a lower shape (rows 14-21, columns 5-9 and 19-24). Actually there is a shape at rows 14-21, columns 5-9 and 19-24. That shape seems like two vertical lines at columns 5 and 9 and a horizontal bar at row 19-21? Actually row 19 has 1's at 5,9,19-24. Row 20 has 1's at 5,9,19,24. Row 21 has 1's at 5-9 and 19,24. Row 22 has 1's at 19,24. Row 23 has 1's at 19-24. So shape is maybe a rectangle at columns 5-9, rows 14-21? Actually row 14 has 1's at 5-10. Row 15-18 have 1's at 5 and 9. Row 19-21 have 1's at 5-9 and 19-24. Row 22-23 have 1's at 19-24. So shape is complex.\n\nBut the output for Example 1 shows 8's inserted in many places: Let's examine the output for Example 1 again, but focusing on the lower part.\n\nOutput rows 8-13: For row 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 8 at column 15? Actually row 8 output: indices: 0-11 zeros, 12 1,13 1,14 1,15 8,16 1,17 1,18 1,19 1,20 1,21-27 zeros. So 8 at column 15. Row 9 output: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 8's at columns 13-20? Actually row 9 output: indices: 0-11 zeros, 12 1, 13 8,14 8,15 8,16 8,17 8,18 8,19 8,20 1, rest zeros. So 8 at columns 13-19. Row 10 output: same as row 9. Row 11: same as row 9. Row 12: same as row 9. Row 13 output: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So row 13 output: 1's at 12-20. So 8's are inserted at interior of shape between rows 9-12? Actually interior of shape at rows 9-12, columns 13-19? That matches the interior of the shape at rows 8-13, columns 12-20. So 8's fill interior.\n\nSimilarly, lower shape at rows 14-23, columns 5-9 and 19-24: The output shows 8's inserted at interior. Let's examine output rows 14-23:\n\nRow 14 output: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 8's at columns 5-10? Actually row 14 output: indices: 0-4 zeros, 5 8,6 8,7 8,8 8,9 8,10 8, rest zeros. So 8 at columns 5-10. Row 15 output: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 8 at column 5. Row 16: same as row 15. Row 17: same. Row 18: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So 8 at column 5. Row 19 output: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\". So 8 at columns 5-10 and 20-24. Row 20: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\". So 8 at columns 5-10. Row 21: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\". So 8 at columns 5-10 and 20-24. Row 22: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\". So 8 at columns 5-10. Row 23: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So 8 at columns 5-10. Row 24: all zeros. Row 25: all zeros.\n\nSo 8's fill interior of shape at rows 14-23, columns 5-10 and 19-24. Indeed interior cells inside left block (rows 15-22, columns 6-9) and right block (rows 15-22, columns 20-23) are filled with 8's. But also some 8's at row 14 at columns 5-10? But row 14 is the top of the shape (row 14 has 1's at 5-10). But 8's appear at row 14 at columns 5-10? Actually row 14 output: 8's at columns 5-10. But input row 14 had 1's at 5-10. So why 8's at row 14? Wait input row 14: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1's at 5-10. Output row 14: 8's at 5-10. So 1's replaced by 8's? Wait output row 14: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1's replaced by 8's. That contradicts earlier rule that 1's remain unchanged. In Example 1, the 1's at row 14 (top of lower shape) are replaced by 8's. But in Example 1, earlier we saw 1's remained unchanged in other parts. But let's check: In Example 1 output, at row 2, 1's remain 1. At row 3, 1's remain 1. At row 4, 1's remain 1. At row 5, 1's remain 1. At row 6, 1's remain 1. At row 8, 1's remain 1. At row 9, 1's remain 1. At row 10, 1's remain 1. At row 11, 1's remain 1. At row 12, 1's remain 1. At row 13, 1's remain 1. At row 14, 1's replaced by 8's. So the top row of the lower shape changed. But why? Let's check row 15: Input row 15 has 1's at 5 and 9. Output row 15 has 8 at column 5 and 1 at column 9? Actually output row 15: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 1 at column 9 remains 1. So 1 at column 5 changed to 8. Row 16: same as row 15: 8 at column 5, 1 at column 9. Row 17: same. Row 18: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So 1 at column 5 changed to 8, 1 at column 9 remains 1, 1's at columns 19-24 remain 1. So 1 at column 5 changed to 8. Row 19: input had 1 at 5,9,19-24. Output row 19: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\". So 1 at column 5 changed to 8, 1 at column 9 changed to 8? Wait output row 19: 8 at column 5-10? Actually row 19 output: 8 at columns 5-10, 1 at column 19, 8 at columns 20-24. So 1 at column 9 changed to 8. So the left block top row changed from 1's to 8's. Similarly, right block top row changed from 1's to 8's. But in the top shape (rows 2-6), the top row (row 2) 1's remained 1. So why top row changed for lower shape but not top shape? Let's examine the top shape: The top shape's top row is row 2: 1's at 2-8 and 19-26. In output row 2, 1's remain 1. So top row of top shape remains 1. But top row of lower shape changed to 8. Why difference? Maybe because the top shape is a \"C\" shape open on left side? Actually left block of top shape has vertical line at column 8 continuous, but left side at column 2 missing at row 4. So shape is open on left side. The top row of that shape is at row 2, which is part of the top horizontal bar. That remained 1. But lower shape's top row (row 14) is part of the top horizontal bar as well, but changed to 8. So maybe the rule is: For shapes that are open on left side, the top horizontal bar is replaced with 8? But top shape's left side is missing at row 4, but top shape's top horizontal bar remains 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: For shapes that have an opening on the left side, fill the top row with 8? But top shape has opening on left side at row 4, but top row remains 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: For shapes that have an opening on the left side, but also have a vertical line on the left side? The top shape has vertical line at column 8, but no vertical line at column 2? But the left shape of lower shape has vertical line at column 5 and 9? Actually lower shape: left block: vertical line at column 5 continuous? Let's examine: Input lower shape: row 14: 1's at 5-10. Row 15: 1's at 5 and 9. Row 16: 1's at 5 and 9. Row 17: 1's at 5 and 9. Row 18: 1's at 5 and 9. Row 19: 1's at 5-9. Row 20: 1's at 5 and 9. Row 21: 1's at 5-9. Row 22: 1's at 5 and 9. Row 23: 1's at 5-9. So vertical line at column 5 continuous, vertical line at column 9 continuous. So left block is a rectangle: top horizontal bar at row 14, bottom horizontal bar at row 23, vertical bars at columns 5 and 9. So shape is a rectangle. So top row of this shape is row 14. In output row 14, 1's replaced by 8. So the rule might be: For rectangular shapes, fill interior with 8 and also replace the top horizontal bar with 8? But in Example 1, the top shape is also a rectangle? Actually top shape left block: top horizontal bar at row 2, bottom horizontal bar at row 6, vertical bars at columns 2 and 8? But vertical bar at column 2 is missing at row 4. So shape is not a rectangle. So top shape is not a rectangle. So maybe the rule is: For rectangular shapes, replace the top horizontal bar with 8's (and maybe also the bottom horizontal bar?). But bottom horizontal bar at row 6 remains 1. So no.\n\nWait, let's check output row 6: Input row 6 had 1's at 2-8 and 20-26. Output row 6: 1's at 2-8 and 20-26 remain 1. So bottom horizontal bar remains 1. So rectangular shape top bar changed to 8 but bottom bar remains 1? That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: For shapes that are symmetrical or have a vertical line connecting them, fill the vertical line connecting them with 8? But no.\n\nLet's examine Example 2: The shape there is a rectangle: left block and right block. In output, the top horizontal bar remains 1. So the rule in Example 2: For rectangular shapes, interior filled with 8, but top and bottom bars remain 1. So that matches a rectangle shape. So why in Example 1 lower shape's top bar changed to 8? Let's double-check: Input lower shape's top bar at row 14: 1's at columns 5-10. Output row 14: 8's at columns 5-10. So top bar changed. But maybe that shape is not a rectangle? But we just determined it is a rectangle: vertical bars at 5 and 9, horizontal bars at row 14 and 23. So it is a rectangle. So why top bar changed? Wait, maybe the shape is not fully closed because the top bar at row 14 is not continuous? Actually row 14 has 1's at columns 5-10 inclusive, which is continuous. So it's a rectangle. So why top bar changed? Let's re-check: Did we misinterpret output row 14? Let's examine output row 14 again: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 8's at columns 5-10. So indeed 1's replaced by 8. So top horizontal bar changed. But bottom horizontal bar at row 23 remains 1. So top bar changed, bottom bar unchanged. So maybe the rule: For each rectangle shape, fill interior with 8 and also fill the top horizontal bar with 8 if the shape's left side is open? But left side is closed. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the rule: For each rectangle shape, fill interior with 8 and also fill the top row of the shape with 8 if the shape's left side is not a vertical line? But left side of lower shape has vertical line at column 5 continuous. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: For each shape, fill interior with 8, but if the shape is a \"C\" shape open on one side, then fill the interior and also fill the missing side with 8? But lower shape is not a \"C\" shape; it's a rectangle. So no.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the lower shape: Wait, maybe we mis-identified the lower shape. Let's re-express the lower shape coordinates: The lower shape seems to be two separate shapes: one at columns 5-10 and one at columns 19-24. Actually there might be two separate shapes: left shape at columns 5-10, right shape at columns 19-24. They are separate shapes, not connected. But they share some rows? Let's check: Left shape: row 14 has 1's at 5-10. Row 15-18 have 1's at 5 and 9. Row 19 has 1's at 5-9. Row 20 has 1's at 5 and 9. Row 21 has 1's at 5-9. Row 22 has 1's at 5 and 9. Row 23 has 1's at 5-9. So left shape is a rectangle? Actually left shape: vertical bars at 5 and 9, horizontal bars at row 14 and row 23. So yes rectangle.\n\nRight shape: row 14 has 1's at 19-24? Wait row 14: 1's at 19-24? Actually row 14 input: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Wait row 14 has 1's at 5-10 only. So no 1's at 19-24. Row 15: 1's at 5 and 9. Row 16: same. Row 17: same. Row 18: 1's at 5,9,19-24. So right shape starts at row 18? Actually row 18 input: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So 1's at 5,9,19-24. Row 19: 1's at 5,9,19-24. Row 20: 1's at 5,9,19,24. Row 21: 1's at 5-9,19,24. Row 22: 1's at 19,24. Row 23: 1's at 19-24. So right shape is a rectangle: vertical bars at 19 and 24, horizontal bars at row 18 and row 23. But row 18 has horizontal bar at 19-24 inclusive. Row 23 has horizontal bar at 19-24 inclusive. So right shape is a rectangle. So lower shape consists of two separate rectangles: left rectangle at columns 5-9, rows 14-23, and right rectangle at columns 19-24, rows 18-23. They are separate. So each rectangle's top horizontal bar remains 1? Let's check left rectangle: top horizontal bar at row 14, columns 5-9. Output row 14: 8's at 5-9. So top bar changed to 8. Right rectangle: top horizontal bar at row 18, columns 19-24. Output row 18: 8 at 20-24? Wait output row 18: \"0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\". So at row 18, columns 19-24: 1 at 19? Actually output row 18: 1 at column 19? Let's parse: indices: 0-4 zeros, 5 8,6-8 zeros, 9 1,10-14 zeros, 15-18 zeros, 19 1,20 8,21 8,22 8,23 8,24 8,25-27 zeros. So 1 at 19, 8 at 20-24. So top bar at row 18: 1 at 19 remains 1, 8 at 20-24. So top bar partially changed: the leftmost cell at 19 remains 1, but the rest replaced by 8. So not fully replaced. So the rule might be: For each rectangle, fill interior with 8. Additionally, fill the top row of the rectangle with 8, except for the leftmost cell? But in left rectangle, top row all replaced by 8. In right rectangle, top row 1 at leftmost remains 1, rest replaced by 8. That seems odd.\n\nLet's examine the top rectangle at row 1: Input row 1: 1's at 1-6 and 15-22. Output row 1: same 1's. So top rectangle's top row remains 1. So rule: For rectangle shapes, interior filled with 8. But some shapes also have top row changed to 8. But why only some? Maybe the rule is: For rectangle shapes that are not the topmost shape (i.e., not at the top of the grid), fill the top row with 8? But left rectangle at row 14 is not topmost, so top row changed. Right rectangle at row 18 also not topmost, top row partially changed. But top rectangle at row 1 is topmost, so top row unchanged. That might be the rule: For each rectangle shape that is not at the top of the grid, replace the top row of the rectangle with 8. But why partially changed for right rectangle? Let's check right rectangle: Top row at row 18: columns 19-24. In output, 1 at column 19 remains 1, 8 at columns 20-24. So leftmost cell remains 1. So maybe the rule: Replace all but the leftmost cell of the top row with 8? But left rectangle had leftmost cell at column 5, but output row 14 had 8 at column 5 too. So leftmost cell also replaced by 8. So not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: For each rectangle shape, fill interior with 8. Then, for each rectangle shape, if it shares a side with another rectangle shape, maybe the side that is shared remains 1? But left rectangle at row 14 shares side with right rectangle at row 18? No, they are separate. But maybe the top rectangle at row 1 shares a side with the left rectangle at row 14? No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: For each rectangle shape, fill interior with 8. Then, for each rectangle shape, if there is a gap between its top horizontal bar and the next shape's bottom horizontal bar, fill the gap with 8? But not.\n\nLet's analyze the shapes again.\n\nIn Example 1, there are multiple shapes: top-left shape (C shape), top-right shape (C shape), middle shape (maybe a rectangle or a shape), bottom-left shape (rectangle), bottom-right shape (rectangle). The 8's appear in interior of shapes and also in some top rows of shapes. Let's list shapes:\n\n- Shape A: top-left C shape: rows 2-6, columns 2-8, vertical bars at 2 (except row 4) and 8 (full). Top horizontal bar at row 2, bottom horizontal bar at row 6. 8's inserted interior rows 3-5, columns 3-7. Also 8 at column 15? Not part of shape.\n\n- Shape B: top-right C shape: rows 2-6, columns 19-26, vertical bars at 19 (except row 4?), 27 (rows 3 and 5), horizontal bars at row 2 and 6. 8's inserted interior rows 3-5, columns 20-25. Also 8 at column 15? Not part of shape.\n\n- Shape C: middle shape: rows 8-13, columns 12-20, vertical bars at 12 and 20? Actually 12 and 20 vertical bars: row 8 has 1's at 12-14 and 16-20; row 9-12 have 1's at 12 and 20; row 13 has 1's at 12-20. So shape is rectangle: top horizontal bar at row 8, bottom horizontal bar at row 13, vertical bars at 12 and 20. 8's inserted interior rows 9-12, columns 13-19. So 8's inserted inside shape.\n\n- Shape D: bottom-left rectangle: rows 14-23, columns 5-9. 8's inserted interior rows 15-22, columns 6-8. Top row row 14 changed to 8 (top horizontal bar replaced). Bottom row row 23 remains 1. So 8's inserted interior and top row replaced by 8.\n\n- Shape E: bottom-right rectangle: rows 18-23, columns 19-24. 8's inserted interior rows 19-22, columns 20-23. Top row row 18 changed partially: 1 at 19 remains, 8 at 20-24. Bottom row row 23 remains 1. So 8's inserted interior and partially top row replaced.\n\nThus shapes A and B are C shapes; shapes C, D, E are rectangles. The rule seems to be: For each rectangle shape, fill interior with 8. For each C shape, fill interior with 8. Additionally, for rectangle shapes that are not at the topmost row (i.e., not the topmost shape in the grid), the top horizontal bar may be replaced with 8 (or partially). But top rectangle C is at row 8, which is not topmost. But its top row remains 1. So top rectangle C's top row not replaced. So maybe the rule is: For rectangles that are not at the topmost row AND have vertical bars at both sides? But shape C has vertical bars at 12 and 20, so yes. But its top row remains 1. So no.\n\nMaybe the rule: For rectangles that are not at the topmost row AND are not the largest rectangle? But shape C is maybe largest rectangle? But shape D and E are also rectangles. So no.\n\nLet's analyze the difference between shape C and shape D/E: shape C's top row remains 1, shape D/E top rows changed. Maybe shape C's top row is adjacent to shape B? Actually shape C is above shape D/E? Let's check: shape C rows 8-13. shape D/E rows 14-23. So shape C is directly above shape D/E. So shape C's top row is row 8, which is above shape D/E. But shape C's top row remains 1. shape D/E top rows changed. So maybe the rule: For rectangles that are adjacent to another shape above them, the top row remains 1; for rectangles that are not adjacent to any shape above them, top row changed? But shape D/E top rows are adjacent to shape C? Actually shape D/E top rows at row 14 and 18 are below shape C. So they are adjacent to shape C. But shape C top row remains 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: For each rectangle shape, fill interior with 8. Then, for each rectangle shape, fill the top row with 8 except for the leftmost cell of the rectangle if that cell is adjacent to another shape's left side? But shape D/E leftmost cells at column 5 and 19 maybe adjacent to shape C? Let's check: shape C's vertical bars at columns 12 and 20. So shape D/E leftmost columns 5 and 19 are far from shape C. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: For each rectangle shape, fill interior with 8. Then, for each rectangle shape, if the rectangle's top horizontal bar is not the topmost row of the grid, replace that entire top horizontal bar with 8. But shape C's top horizontal bar at row 8 would be replaced by 8, but it's not. So maybe shape C's top horizontal bar is considered part of shape A or B? But shape C is separate. But maybe shape C is not considered a rectangle because it's not fully closed? Wait shape C: top horizontal bar at row 8 from 12-20 inclusive. bottom horizontal bar at row 13 from 12-20 inclusive. vertical bars at 12 and 20. So it's a rectangle. So rule fails.\n\nLet's re-examine shape C: Did we misinterpret shape C? Input row 8: 1's at 12-14 and 16-20. So there's a gap at 15. So top horizontal bar is not continuous: 12-14, then 16-20. So shape C is not a rectangle; it's a rectangle with a missing cell at 15. So shape C is like a rectangle with a missing cell at the top row. So shape C is not fully closed; it's a rectangle with a missing top cell at column 15. So maybe the rule: For shapes that are rectangular outlines, fill interior with 8. For shapes that are rectangular outlines but missing one cell in the top row, replace that missing cell with 8? But shape C's missing cell at 15 is replaced by 8? In output row 8, column 15 is 8. Yes! So shape C: top row missing cell at 15 replaced by 8. But shape D/E are rectangles with no missing cells. So they are fully closed. So why top rows changed? Let's re-examine shape D: left rectangle at columns 5-9. Top row row 14 has 1's at 5-9. So no missing cells. But output row 14 replaced all 1's with 8. So shape D's top row changed fully. But shape D is a rectangle. So maybe the rule: For rectangles that are not the largest rectangle? But shape D is not largest. But shape C is not rectangle? Actually shape C is a rectangle with missing cell at top row. So maybe shape C is not considered a rectangle. So shape D/E are rectangles. So rule: For rectangles, fill interior with 8, but also fill the top row with 8? But shape C's top row changed partially (only missing cell replaced). But shape D/E top row changed fully (all cells replaced). So maybe the rule: For rectangles, fill interior with 8, and also fill the top row with 8. But shape C's top row had a missing cell, so only that missing cell replaced by 8. But why didn't the other cells also become 8? Because they are part of the rectangle's border; maybe border cells remain unchanged? But shape D/E top row cells are border cells, but they were changed to 8. So no.\n\nLet's analyze shape D/E top rows: In output row 14, the 1's at 5-9 changed to 8. But those 1's are border cells. So border cells changed to 8. But shape C's border cells at row 8 (columns 12-14, 16-20) remained 1. So border cells remained 1 for shape C but changed to 8 for shape D/E. So maybe the rule: For rectangles that are not adjacent to any other shape on the left side, the leftmost border cell remains 1? But shape D/E leftmost border cell at column 5 changed to 8. So no.\n\nWait, maybe the rule: For rectangles that have no other shape on the same side, the border remains 1. But shape D/E have no shape on left side? But shape C has shape B on right side? But shape D/E have shape C above them? But shape D/E top rows changed. So no.\n\nLet's step back and analyze the transformation across the entire grid. Perhaps the rule is: For each shape of 1's, we need to fill the interior with 8. Additionally, we need to fill the \"hole\" in the shape's interior if the shape is a rectangle. But shape D/E have no holes. But we see 8's at top row. That is not interior. So maybe we misinterpret 8's at top row: maybe they are interior cells due to shape being rotated? Let's examine shape D/E more closely.\n\nShape D/E: The shape at columns 5-9, rows 14-23. This shape is a rectangle. Its interior is rows 15-22, columns 6-8. In output, we see 8's at those interior cells. But we also see 8's at row 14, columns 5-9. That is the top border. Why would top border be considered interior? It might be because the shape is \"C\" shaped open on top? But shape D/E's top border is continuous. But maybe the shape is considered a \"C\" shape open at top because the top border is missing the leftmost cell? But row 14 has 1 at column 5? Actually row 14 input: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So row 14 has 1 at column 5,6,7,8,9. So leftmost cell at column 5 is present. So shape D/E is a rectangle. So why top border replaced by 8? Maybe because the shape is oriented vertically and we need to fill the top border with 8 if the shape is vertical? But shape C is horizontal, top border remained 1. So maybe the rule: For rectangles that are vertical (i.e., width > height?), fill top border with 8? But shape D/E width=5, height=10. So width < height. So vertical orientation. shape C width=9, height=6. So width > height. So horizontal orientation. So maybe rule: For vertical rectangles, fill top border with 8. For horizontal rectangles, top border remains 1. That would explain shape D/E top border replaced, shape C top border remains 1. But shape D/E left border at column 5 replaced too? But left border is vertical, not top. So not.\n\nBut shape D/E left border remains 1? Wait output row 14: 8 at column 5. So left border changed to 8. So left border changed. So rule not about orientation.\n\nMaybe the rule: For rectangles that are not at the topmost row of the grid, fill the entire top border with 8. But shape C's top border at row 8 remains 1, so shape C is not at topmost row but top border not replaced. So rule fails.\n\nLet's examine shape C top border: row 8 has 1's at 12-14 and 16-20. In output row 8, 1's at 12-14 and 16-20 remain 1. So top border unchanged. So shape C's top border remains 1. So shape C is a rectangle but missing one cell at column 15. So maybe the rule: For rectangles that are missing a cell in the top border, fill that missing cell with 8 but keep other border cells unchanged. For rectangles that have complete top border, fill entire top border with 8. That would explain shape C: missing cell at column 15 replaced by 8. shape D/E: complete top border replaced by 8. shape C's top border had missing cell, so only missing cell replaced. That matches.\n\nThus the rule: For each rectangle shape of 1's (i.e., a shape that forms an outline of a rectangle, with potential missing cells), fill interior cells with 8. Additionally, fill the top border cells that are missing (i.e., where there is a gap) with 8, but if the top border is complete, replace all top border cells with 8? But why would we replace all top border cells? But shape D/E top border replaced fully. So yes.\n\nBut why shape D/E top border replaced fully? Because top border is complete. So rule: For each rectangle shape, fill interior cells with 8. Then, for the top border, replace all cells with 8. But shape C top border is incomplete, but we replaced only the missing cell? Wait shape C top border had missing cell at column 15. But we replaced only that missing cell with 8. But if we replaced all top border cells with 8, we would change the existing 1's to 8. But we didn't. So rule: For each rectangle shape, fill interior cells with 8. Then, if the top border is complete (i.e., all cells are 1), replace them all with 8. If the top border is incomplete, fill only the missing cells with 8. But shape D/E top border is complete, so replaced all with 8. shape C top border incomplete, so only missing cell replaced. shape A and B are C shapes (not rectangles). For them, we didn't fill top border at all. So rule might be: For each shape that is a rectangle (i.e., has top and bottom horizontal bars and left and right vertical bars), fill interior with 8 and also fill top border with 8. For shapes that are not rectangles, we only fill interior. But shape C is not a rectangle because top border incomplete, but we still treat it as rectangle? But we treat it as rectangle because it has left and right vertical bars and bottom horizontal bar. So maybe we treat any shape that has left and right vertical bars and bottom horizontal bar as a rectangle. But shape C top border incomplete, but still qualifies. So we fill interior and top border? But we didn't fill top border except missing cell. So maybe we fill top border only for complete rectangles? But shape C incomplete rectangle, so we fill only missing cell. That matches.\n\nBut why fill missing cell? Because maybe we want to \"complete\" the rectangle shape by filling missing cells with 8. So the rule: For each shape that has a rectangular outline but might be incomplete, fill the missing cells in the outline with 8. For shape C, missing cell at top border column 15 replaced with 8. For shape D/E, no missing cells, so we fill entire top border with 8? But that would be replacing existing 1's with 8. That is not \"filling missing cells\", but \"overwriting\" border cells with 8. But maybe the rule is: For each rectangle shape, fill interior with 8. Then, for each rectangle shape, fill the top border with 8. But if the top border already has 1's, they get replaced by 8. But shape C top border had 1's at 12-14 and 16-20. They remained 1. So rule didn't replace them. So maybe the rule: For rectangle shapes, fill interior with 8. Then, if the top border is incomplete, fill missing cells with 8. But if the top border is complete, we do not modify it. But shape D/E top border is complete, but we did modify it. So rule fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe shape D/E top border is considered incomplete because the shape is missing the leftmost cell? But shape D/E leftmost cell at column 5 is present. So not.\n\nLet's examine shape D/E top border again: Input row 14: 1's at columns 5-9. Output row 14: 8's at columns 5-9. So all 1's replaced by 8. So top border changed. So shape D/E top border is complete but replaced. So rule: For rectangles that are not at the topmost row of the grid, replace top border with 8. shape C top border replaced partially? Wait shape C top border at row 8 replaced missing cell at 15. But shape C top border is not replaced fully. So shape C top border not replaced fully because shape C is incomplete? But shape D/E top border replaced fully because shape D/E is complete. So rule: For rectangles that are complete, replace top border with 8. For incomplete rectangles, only fill missing cells with 8. That would match shape D/E and shape C. But shape C top border had missing cell at 15 replaced by 8. shape D/E top border had no missing cells, so we replaced entire top border with 8. That matches.\n\nNow, shape A and B are C shapes, not rectangles. They have missing vertical sides. They are not rectangles. So we only fill interior, not top border. That matches.\n\nThus the rule: Identify rectangular shapes of 1's (connected components that have at least two horizontal bars and at least two vertical bars, i.e., a rectangle outline). For each such rectangle shape, fill the interior cells with 8. Then, if the rectangle's top horizontal bar is complete (i.e., no missing cells), replace all those cells with 8. If the top horizontal bar is incomplete, fill the missing cells with 8. For C shapes, do not modify top bar.\n\nBut shape D/E are rectangles, top border complete, replaced fully. shape C is rectangle, top border incomplete, missing cell replaced.\n\nNow, shape C's interior cells replaced with 8. shape D/E interior replaced with 8. shape A/B interior replaced with 8. That matches.\n\nNow, why shape D/E top border replaced fully? Because it's a rectangle with complete top border. So rule: Replace top border with 8. But why shape C's top border not replaced fully? Because it's incomplete. So rule: Replace only missing cells. That matches.\n\nNow, shape C's top border missing one cell at column 15. So we replaced that missing cell with 8. But we did not replace other cells. So rule holds.\n\nNow, shape D/E top border replaced fully. So rule holds.\n\nNow, shape A/B are C shapes, not rectangles. So we didn't modify top border. So rule holds.\n\nThus we have a consistent rule: For each rectangle shape, fill interior with 8. Then, if the top horizontal bar is incomplete, fill missing cells with 8; if complete, replace all cells in top horizontal bar with 8.\n\nNow, let's check Example 2 to see if this rule holds.\n\nExample 2 shapes:\n\n- Shape left rectangle: rows 1-6, columns 1-6. Top horizontal bar at row 1, columns 1-6. In input, top bar complete. In output, top bar remains 1. But according to rule, for rectangle shapes, we should replace top bar with 8 if complete. But output shows top bar unchanged. So rule fails.\n\nWait, but maybe shape left rectangle is not considered a rectangle because its top border is not at the topmost row? But shape left rectangle's top border at row 1 is not at the topmost row (row 0). But maybe the rule: For rectangles that are not at the topmost row of the grid, we replace top border with 8? But shape left rectangle's top border at row 1 is not at topmost row, so we should replace it. But we didn't. So rule fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: For rectangles that are not at the topmost row of the grid AND have no other shape above them? But shape left rectangle has no shape above it. So still.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: For rectangles that are not at the topmost row of the grid AND are not adjacent to other shapes? But shape left rectangle is adjacent to nothing above. So still.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: For rectangles that are not at the topmost row of the grid AND are not the largest rectangle? But shape left rectangle is not the largest rectangle? Actually shape left rectangle and right rectangle are same size. So shape left rectangle is not largest? But shape left rectangle is as large as right rectangle. So rule fails.\n\nThus our rule is not correct.\n\nLet's analyze Example 2 again. In Example 2, there are two rectangular shapes: left rectangle at columns 1-6, rows 1-6; right rectangle at columns 15-22, rows 1-5. Wait right rectangle at row 1 has 1's at columns 15-22. But bottom horizontal bar at row 5? Actually row 5 has 1's at columns 15-22? Wait row 5 input: \"0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\". So row 5 has 1's at columns 15-22 inclusive. So right rectangle's bottom horizontal bar at row 5. So shape right rectangle: rows 1-5, columns 15-22. So shape left rectangle: rows 1-6, columns 1-6. So left rectangle is 6 rows tall, 6 columns wide. Right rectangle is 5 rows tall, 8 columns wide. So shapes differ.\n\nNow, interior of left rectangle: rows 2-5, columns 2-5. In output, these cells are 8. Yes. Interior of right rectangle: rows 2-4, columns 16-21. In output, these cells are 8. Yes. So interior filled with 8 for both rectangles. Good.\n\nNow, top border of left rectangle at row 1: 1's at columns 1-6. In output, these remain 1. Top border of right rectangle at row 1: 1's at columns 15-22. In output, remain 1. So top border unchanged.\n\nThus for rectangles, we didn't modify top border. So rule: For rectangles, fill interior with 8, but leave top border unchanged. That matches Example 2. But in Example 1, we saw top border of rectangles changed. So why difference? Let's examine shape D/E in Example 1: They are rectangles. Top border changed to 8. But maybe those rectangles are \"nested\" or \"overlapping\" with other shapes? Let's check: shape D/E top border at row 14 and 18. Are there shapes above them? Yes, shape C is above them. But shape C is a rectangle (with missing top cell). So maybe shape D/E are rectangles that are \"adjacent\" to shape C above them. For these rectangles, we modify top border? But shape left rectangle in Example 2 is not adjacent to any shape above it (topmost row). But shape D/E are adjacent to shape C above them. So maybe rule: For rectangles that are adjacent to another rectangle above them (i.e., share a side), modify top border to 8. But shape left rectangle in Example 2 has no rectangle above it. So no modification. That might explain.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with shape C in Example 1. Shape C is a rectangle with missing top cell at row 8. It has shape A and B above it? Actually shape A and B are above shape C. But shape C top border incomplete. So maybe we modify missing cell only. But shape D/E top border changed fully because shape C above them? But shape D/E top border changed fully, not partially. So maybe rule: For rectangles that are adjacent to another rectangle above them, we replace the entire top border with 8. But shape C is adjacent to shape A and B above it. But shape C's top border is incomplete. So maybe we fill missing cells only. But shape D/E are adjacent to shape C above them. So we replace entire top border with 8. That seems plausible.\n\nNow, what about shape D/E top border at row 18? It's adjacent to shape C at row 13? There is a gap of 4 rows between shape C bottom (row 13) and shape E top (row 18). So shape E is not directly adjacent to shape C. But shape D/E top border at row 18 has no shape above it? Actually shape D/E top border at row 18 is above shape C? Wait shape C bottom at row 13. shape E top at row 18. So there's a gap of 4 rows. So shape E is not adjacent to shape C. But shape D/E top border changed fully. So rule fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe shape D/E top border changed fully because they are the only rectangles in that region? But shape C is a rectangle above them. So maybe rule: For rectangles that are not the topmost rectangle in the grid, replace top border with 8. But shape C is not the topmost rectangle; topmost rectangle is shape A? Actually shape A is a C shape, not rectangle. So topmost rectangle is shape C at row 8. But shape C top border remains 1. So rule fails.\n\nLet's examine shape D/E top border again. In Example 1, shape D/E top border changed fully. But shape D/E top border at row 14 and 18. But shape D/E are rectangles. So maybe rule: For rectangles that are not the leftmost rectangle? But shape D/E leftmost rectangle? No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: For rectangles that have a gap between the left and right vertical bars (i.e., width > 1), we replace top border with 8? But shape C also width > 1 (9 cells). But top border unchanged. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: For rectangles that have interior cells that are all zeros, we fill interior with 8. But also we fill top border with 8 if the rectangle is not \"complete\" (i.e., missing a cell in the top border). But shape D/E top border complete, but we replaced entire top border. So no.\n\nWait, maybe shape D/E top border replaced fully because the rectangle's interior cells are not all zeros? Actually interior cells of shape D/E are zeros. So we fill them with 8. But top border replaced fully. But shape C interior cells also zeros. But top border incomplete. So rule not consistent.\n\nLet's examine shape D/E again. In output, shape D/E top border replaced fully. But shape D/E interior replaced with 8. So shape D/E changed both top border and interior. But shape C changed only interior and missing top cell. So shape D/E top border changed because the rectangle's top border is complete. But shape C top border incomplete, so we only fill missing cell. That is consistent with rule: For rectangles, fill interior with 8. Then, if the top border is complete, replace it with 8. If incomplete, fill missing cells with 8. But shape C top border incomplete, so we fill missing cell only. But shape D/E top border complete, so we replace entire top border with 8. That matches.\n\nBut shape left rectangle in Example 2: top border complete, but we didn't replace it. So rule fails. So maybe shape left rectangle is not considered a rectangle? But it is. So maybe shape left rectangle is considered a rectangle but we didn't replace top border because it's at the topmost row of the grid? But shape left rectangle top border at row 1, not topmost row (row 0). But maybe the rule: For rectangles that are not at the topmost row of the grid AND are not the leftmost rectangle? But shape left rectangle is leftmost rectangle. So maybe rule: For rectangles that are not at the topmost row AND are not the leftmost rectangle, replace top border. But shape D/E are not leftmost rectangle? Actually shape D/E leftmost rectangle at columns 5-9. shape left rectangle at columns 1-6. But shape D/E top border replaced fully. So rule fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe shape left rectangle is the only rectangle that has a top border that is not adjacent to any other shape? But shape D/E top border is adjacent to shape C? Actually shape C top border at row 8. shape D/E top border at row 14 and 18. There's no shape between them. So not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe shape left rectangle is the only rectangle that has a vertical side that is adjacent to a shape at the left side? But shape D/E left side adjacent to shape C? No.\n\nMaybe shape left rectangle is considered a \"border\" shape that encloses the entire grid? But no.\n\nLet's examine shape left rectangle more carefully: It is at columns 1-6, rows 1-6. In input, left rectangle's left vertical side at column 1 is at rows 1-6. Right vertical side at column 6 is at rows 1-6. Top horizontal side at row 1 at columns 1-6. Bottom horizontal side at row 6 at columns 1-6. So it's a perfect rectangle. In output, interior replaced with 8. Top border remains 1. Bottom border remains 1. So rule: For rectangles, fill interior with 8, but leave top and bottom borders unchanged. That matches Example 2.\n\nBut shape D/E top border replaced fully. So shape D/E not following rule. So shape D/E must be considered something else. Maybe shape D/E are not rectangles but something else? But shape D/E appear to be rectangles. But maybe they are \"nested\" inside another shape? But shape D/E are inside shape C? Actually shape C is above them. But shape D/E are not nested inside shape C; they are separate shapes.\n\nLet's examine shape D/E top border: Input row 14: 1's at 5-9. Output row 14: 8's at 5-9. So top border changed. So shape D/E must be considered something else. Maybe shape D/E are \"C\" shapes that open on the top side? But shape D/E top border is continuous, not open. But maybe shape D/E is a \"U\" shape that opens at the top? But shape D/E top border is continuous, but maybe the shape is considered a \"C\" shape because one side is missing? But shape D/E left vertical side at column 5 is present, right vertical side at column 9 is present. So shape D/E is a rectangle. But maybe shape D/E is considered a \"C\" shape because the bottom horizontal bar is missing at row 23? Wait shape D/E bottom horizontal bar at row 23: 1's at 5-9. So bottom bar present. So shape D/E is rectangle.\n\nThus shape D/E is rectangle. But rule for rectangles in Example 2 is to leave top border unchanged. So shape D/E should not change top border. But it does. So something else must be going on.\n\nMaybe shape D/E are not considered rectangles because they are not \"connected\" horizontally? But they are connected: left vertical side at column 5, right vertical side at column 9, top horizontal side at row 14, bottom horizontal side at row 23. So shape D/E is connected.\n\nMaybe shape D/E are considered \"C\" shapes because they are missing one vertical side? But shape D/E has both vertical sides present. But maybe the shape is missing the left vertical side at row 23? But row 23 has 1's at 5-9. So left vertical side present. So not.\n\nMaybe shape D/E is considered a rectangle but with interior that is partially filled with 1's? But interior of shape D/E has 1's at row 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23? Wait interior of shape D/E: rows 15-22, columns 6-8. In input, those cells are zeros. So interior empty. So shape D/E interior empty.\n\nSo shape D/E is rectangle with empty interior. So rule: fill interior with 8. That we did. Top border changed? That might be due to something else.\n\nLet's examine shape D/E's left border at column 5: In output row 14, 8 at column 5. In input row 14, 1 at column 5. So left border changed. So not just top border. So shape D/E border changed fully. So shape D/E border replaced with 8. But shape left rectangle's border remained 1. So shape D/E border replaced with 8, shape left rectangle border remains 1. So difference: shape D/E border replaced with 8. So maybe shape D/E is not a rectangle but something else that triggers border replacement. Perhaps shape D/E is a \"C\" shape open on left side? But shape D/E has left side present. But maybe shape D/E is a \"C\" shape open on right side? But right side present. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe shape D/E is a rectangle that is \"inside\" another shape? But shape D/E is inside shape C? Let's check: shape C at columns 12-20, shape",
    "1": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to solve ARC puzzle. We have 6 training examples (1-6). Each input is a 12x6 grid? Let's check. Example 1 input: Provided 12 rows of 6 numbers each. Output: 3 rows of 6 numbers each. So the output is 3x6 grid. Similarly, Example 2 input 12 rows of 6 numbers, output 3x6. Example 3 input 12 rows of 6, output 3x6. Example 4 input 12 rows of 6, output 3x6. Example 5 input 12 rows of 6, output 3x6. Example 6 input 12 rows of 6, output 3x6. So each input is 12x6 grid. Output is 3x6 grid. So we need to produce a 3x6 output for the test input. The output grid seems to be some transformation or selection of patterns from the input. We need to deduce the rule.\n\nLet's analyze each example. We'll parse the input grid and output grid. Let's list each example.\n\nExample 1 Input:\n\nRow1: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow2: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 4 0 0 0\nRow5: 4 0 4 4 4 0\nRow6: 4 0 0 0 0 0\nRow7: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow8: 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow9: 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow10: 0 8 0 8 0 0\nRow11: 0 8 0 0 0 0\nRow12: 0 8 0 8 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow1: 2 5 5 5 5 2\nRow2: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nSo output is 3 rows of 6 columns.\n\nSimilarly Example 2 Input:\n\nRow1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow2: 0 5 0 5 0 5\nRow3: 0 0 0 5 5 0\nRow4: 0 4 4 0 4 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 0 4\nRow6: 0 4 0 4 0 4\nRow7: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow8: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow9: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow10: 8 0 8 8 8 8\nRow11: 0 0 8 8 8 8\nRow12: 0 0 0 8 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow2: 0 5 8 5 8 5\nRow3: 2 4 2 5 5 4\n\nExample 3 Input:\n\nRow1: 5 0 5 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 5 0 0 5\nRow3: 5 0 5 0 5 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 4 0 4\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 0 0\nRow6: 4 0 0 4 0 4\nRow7: 0 0 2 0 0 2\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 2 0\nRow9: 2 2 0 0 0 2\nRow10: 8 8 0 8 8 8\nRow11: 8 8 8 8 8 0\nRow12: 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow1: 5 8 5 4 8 4\nRow2: 8 8 5 4 8 5\nRow3: 5 8 5 4 5 4\n\nExample 4 Input:\n\nRow1: 5 5 5 5 0 0\nRow2: 0 5 5 0 5 5\nRow3: 0 5 5 5 5 5\nRow4: 4 4 4 0 4 4\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 4 0\nRow6: 4 4 4 0 4 0\nRow7: 2 0 2 2 0 0\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 0 0\nRow9: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow10: 0 0 8 0 8 8\nRow11: 8 8 8 0 0 0\nRow12: 0 8 0 0 8 0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow1: 5 5 5 5 4 4\nRow2: 8 5 5 4 5 5\nRow3: 4 5 5 5 5 5\n\nExample 5 Input:\n\nRow1: 5 0 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 5 0 0 0 5\nRow3: 0 0 5 5 5 0\nRow4: 4 4 0 4 4 4\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 4 0\nRow6: 4 0 4 4 0 0\nRow7: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 2 0\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 0 2\nRow10: 8 8 8 8 0 8\nRow11: 0 0 0 8 8 0\nRow12: 0 0 0 8 8 8\n\nOutput:\n\nRow1: 5 4 8 4 4 4\nRow2: 2 5 0 4 4 5\nRow3: 4 0 5 5 5 8\n\nExample 6 Input:\n\nRow1: 0 5 0 5 5 0\nRow2: 0 5 0 5 5 5\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow4: 4 0 0 0 4 4\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 4 0\nRow6: 4 0 4 0 0 4\nRow7: 0 2 2 2 2 0\nRow8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow9: 0 2 0 2 0 0\nRow10: 8 0 0 8 0 8\nRow11: 8 0 0 0 8 0\nRow12: 8 0 0 8 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow1: 4 5 2 5 5 4\nRow2: 8 5 2 5 5 5\nRow3: 5 5 4 5 5 5\n\nSo we need to figure out rule mapping 12x6 to 3x6.\n\nObservations: The output seems to combine features from the input. The output grid uses colors 0, 2, 4, 5, 8. Those are the colors present in the input. The output uses all colors. The output appears to be a 3x6 subgrid extracted from the input? Let's check. For example 1 output: 3x6 grid: \nRow1: 2 5 5 5 5 2\nRow2: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nDoes this appear somewhere in the input? Let's search. Input rows 1-12. The output 3x6 subgrid could be taken from some location. Let's check if there is a subgrid of size 3x6 that matches. In Input1, row 1-3 of the input: \nRow1: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow2: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nComparing to output: output row1: 2 5 5 5 5 2 vs input row1: 0 5 5 5 5 0. So not same. But maybe output is some transformation of that subgrid. Let's compare each element: \nInput row1: 0 -> output row1: 2\nInput row2: 5 -> output row2: 5 (match)\nInput row3: 5 -> output row3: 5 (match)\nBut row1 col1 changed from 0 to 2. Row1 col6 changed from 0 to 2. So maybe output is the \"intersection\" of some shapes? Let's analyze each color.\n\nIn Example 1, input has 5's forming a shape in top-left area (rows 1-3). 0's fill the rest. 4's in rows 4-6. 2's in rows 7-9. 8's in rows 10-12. The output 3x6 grid seems to contain 5's, 4's, 2's, 0's. It doesn't contain 8's. So maybe output is the \"combination\" of the top three layers? Wait, the input seems to be stacked horizontally? Actually each color appears in distinct horizontal bands: 5's top region (rows 1-3). 4's middle region (rows 4-6). 2's next region (rows 7-9). 8's bottom region (rows 10-12). So the input is a vertical stacking of 4 \"layers\" each 3 rows high. The output is a 3x6 grid that seems to be a combination of those layers. For Example 1, the output includes 5's from top layer, 4's from middle layer, 2's from third layer, but not 8's from bottom layer. But it also includes some 0's. So maybe output is the \"vertical projection\" of each layer onto a single 3x6 grid: maybe we overlay the layers? But we only overlay 3 layers? Wait, we have 4 layers; output uses 3 layers maybe because bottom layer 8's are not used? But Example 2 output uses 5,8,2,4? Let's check.\n\nExample 2 input: 5's top region (rows 1-3). 4's next region (rows 4-6). 2's next region (rows 7-9). 8's bottom region (rows 10-12). Output: 3x6 grid with 5's,8's,2's,4's. It contains 8's. So output uses 4 colors: 5,8,2,4. So all 4 colors appear? Wait, check output of Example 2: \nRow1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow2: 0 5 8 5 8 5\nRow3: 2 4 2 5 5 4\n\nYes, 8 appears. So output uses 5,8,2,4,0. So all colors except maybe 0? Actually 0 appears as well. So output uses all 5 colors (0,2,4,5,8). But Example 1 output also uses all 5 colors: 0,2,4,5,8? Wait, output of Example 1: 2,5,4,0. Does it contain 8? No. So maybe output uses only 4 colors: 0,2,4,5? But 8 is missing. But maybe 8 is not present in the top 3 layers? Actually 8 appears only in bottom layer. So maybe the output uses the first 3 layers? But Example 2 uses 8. Let's check Example 2 input: bottom layer (rows 10-12) contains 8's. Output includes 8's. So why did Example 1 output not include 8? Let's examine Example 1 bottom layer rows 10-12: \nRow10: 0 8 0 8 0 0\nRow11: 0 8 0 0 0 0\nRow12: 0 8 0 8 0 0\n\nSo bottom layer has 8's but output does not include 8. Maybe because bottom layer is not fully filled? But 8 appears in 3 columns: col2 and col4. But output does not have any 8. So maybe the rule is to select only the layer that has a certain property? Let's examine each example.\n\nExample 1: Output includes 5's (top layer), 4's (middle layer), 2's (next layer). The 8's are absent. So maybe we drop the layer that is \"most symmetric\" or \"most uniform\"? Let's analyze each layer in Example 1.\n\nLayer 1 (rows 1-3): \nRow1: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow2: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nThis layer contains 5's and 0's. It is irregular.\n\nLayer 2 (rows 4-6): \nRow4: 0 0 4 0 0 0\nRow5: 4 0 4 4 4 0\nRow6: 4 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis layer contains 4's and 0's. Irregular.\n\nLayer 3 (rows 7-9): \nRow7: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow8: 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow9: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nIrregular.\n\nLayer 4 (rows 10-12):\nRow10: 0 8 0 8 0 0\nRow11: 0 8 0 0 0 0\nRow12: 0 8 0 8 0 0\n\nIrregular.\n\nSo all layers irregular. But maybe we choose the first 3 layers because there are 3 output rows. That is consistent: output is 3 rows, each corresponding to one of the 3 layers. But then why would we choose top 3 layers? Because output has 3 rows. But maybe the mapping is: For each row in output (1-3), we take the corresponding row from each of the 4 layers, but we combine them in some way? Let's examine Example 1 output row1: 2 5 5 5 5 2. This row seems to be a combination of row1 from layer1 (0 5 5 5 5 0), row1 from layer2 (0 0 4 0 0 0), row1 from layer3 (2 0 2 2 0 2). But the output row1: 2 5 5 5 5 2. How to combine? Let's see each column.\n\nColumn1: Input rows: \n- Layer1 row1 col1: 0\n- Layer2 row1 col1: 0\n- Layer3 row1 col1: 2\n- Layer4 row1 col1: 0\n\nOutput row1 col1: 2. So maybe choose the non-zero value that appears? But there are two zeros and one 2. So output picks 2. That might be the maximum? Or maybe we take the value that appears in the majority? But 2 appears only once. But maybe we choose the \"most frequent\" value across the layers for each cell? But 0 appears twice, 2 once. But output picks 2, not 0. So not majority. Maybe we choose the \"lowest non-zero\"? 2 is the lowest non-zero value among {2}. But 0 is zero. But maybe we ignore zeros? That is plausible: For each cell, we look across the 4 layers, pick the first non-zero from top to bottom? Let's test: For column1, top layer (layer1) is 0, skip; next layer (layer2) is 0, skip; next layer (layer3) is 2, pick 2. So output 2. That matches. Column2: Input: \n- Layer1 row1 col2: 5\n- Layer2 row1 col2: 0\n- Layer3 row1 col2: 0\n- Layer4 row1 col2: 8\n\nFirst non-zero from top to bottom is 5. Output col2: 5. Yes. Column3: Input: \n- Layer1 row1 col3: 5\n- Layer2 row1 col3: 4\n- Layer3 row1 col3: 2\n- Layer4 row1 col3: 0\n\nFirst non-zero: 5. Output col3: 5. Yes. Column4: Input: \n- Layer1 row1 col4: 5\n- Layer2 row1 col4: 0\n- Layer3 row1 col4: 2\n- Layer4 row1 col4: 8\n\nFirst non-zero: 5. Output col4: 5. Yes. Column5: Input: \n- Layer1 row1 col5: 5\n- Layer2 row1 col5: 0\n- Layer3 row1 col5: 0\n- Layer4 row1 col5: 0\n\nFirst non-zero: 5. Output col5: 5. Yes. Column6: Input: \n- Layer1 row1 col6: 0\n- Layer2 row1 col6: 0\n- Layer3 row1 col6: 2\n- Layer4 row1 col6: 0\n\nFirst non-zero: 2. Output col6: 2. Yes.\n\nSo output row1 matches \"first non-zero from top to bottom\" across the 4 layers. That seems plausible.\n\nNow let's test output row2: 5 5 4 5 5 5. Let's see input layers row2: \nLayer1 row2: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nLayer2 row2: 0 0 0 0 0 0? Wait, row4? Actually row4 of input is layer2 row1. Wait, we need to align layers properly: The layers are groups of 3 rows each: rows 1-3 layer1, rows 4-6 layer2, rows 7-9 layer3, rows 10-12 layer4. So for row2 of output, we need to consider input rows 2 (layer1 row2), 5 (layer2 row2), 8 (layer3 row2), 11 (layer4 row2). Let's get them:\n\nLayer1 row2: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nLayer2 row2: 0 0 0 0 0 0? Wait, row5 of input is 4 0 4 4 4 0. That's layer2 row2. Let's check: \nInput rows: \n1: 0 5 5 5 5 0\n2: 5 5 0 5 5 5\n3: 5 5 0 5 0 0\n4: 0 0 4 0 0 0\n5: 4 0 4 4 4 0\n6: 4 0 0 0 0 0\n7: 2 0 2 2 0 2\n8: 2 0 0 0 0 2\n9: 0 0 0 2 0 0\n10: 0 8 0 8 0 0\n11: 0 8 0 0 0 0\n12: 0 8 0 8 0 0\n\nSo layer1: rows 1-3. Layer2: rows 4-6. Layer3: rows 7-9. Layer4: rows 10-12.\n\nThus for output row2, we use input rows 2, 5, 8, 11. Let's get them:\n\nRow2: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow5: 4 0 4 4 4 0\nRow8: 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow11: 0 8 0 0 0 0\n\nNow we apply \"first non-zero from top to bottom\" for each column:\n\nColumn1: values: 5 (layer1 row2 col1), 4 (layer2 row2 col1), 2 (layer3 row2 col1), 0 (layer4 row2 col1). First non-zero: 5. Output col1: 5. Yes.\n\nColumn2: values: 5, 0, 0, 8. First non-zero: 5. Output col2: 5. Yes.\n\nColumn3: values: 0, 4, 0, 0. First non-zero: 4. Output col3: 4. Yes.\n\nColumn4: values: 5, 4, 0, 0. First non-zero: 5. Output col4: 5. Yes.\n\nColumn5: values: 5, 4, 0, 0. First non-zero: 5. Output col5: 5. Yes.\n\nColumn6: values: 5, 0, 2, 0. First non-zero: 5. Output col6: 5. Yes.\n\nMatches output row2. Good.\n\nNow output row3: 5 5 0 5 0 0. Input rows 3, 6, 9, 12:\n\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow6: 4 0 0 0 0 0\nRow9: 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow12: 0 8 0 8 0 0\n\nNow \"first non-zero from top to bottom\":\n\nColumn1: 5, 4, 0, 0 => 5. Output col1: 5. Yes.\n\nColumn2: 5, 0, 0, 8 => 5. Output col2: 5. Yes.\n\nColumn3: 0, 0, 0, 0 => 0. Output col3: 0. Yes.\n\nColumn4: 5, 0, 2, 8 => 5. Output col4: 5. Yes.\n\nColumn5: 0, 0, 0, 0 => 0. Output col5: 0. Yes.\n\nColumn6: 0, 0, 0, 0 => 0. Output col6: 0. Yes.\n\nMatches output row3.\n\nThus Example 1 output is indeed the \"overlay\" of the 4 layers using first non-zero from top to bottom for each cell. That yields a 3x6 grid.\n\nNow let's test Example 2 with same rule: overlay top-to-bottom across 4 layers, but we need to pick the row for each output row accordingly. For output row1, we use input rows 1, 4, 7, 10. Let's get them:\n\nInput rows:\n1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\n2: 0 5 0 5 0 5\n3: 0 0 0 5 5 0\n4: 0 4 4 0 4 0\n5: 0 0 0 0 0 4\n6: 0 4 0 4 0 4\n7: 2 2 2 0 0 0\n8: 0 2 2 0 2 0\n9: 2 2 2 0 2 0\n10: 8 0 8 8 8 8\n11: 0 0 8 8 8 8\n12: 0 0 0 8 0 0\n\nThus:\n\nRow1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow4: 0 4 4 0 4 0\nRow7: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow10: 8 0 8 8 8 8\n\nNow overlay: For each column, choose first non-zero from top to bottom:\n\nColumn1: 5, 0, 2, 8 => 5. Output row1 col1: 5. Yes.\n\nColumn2: 5, 4, 2, 0 => 5. Output col2: 5. Yes.\n\nColumn3: 0, 4, 2, 8 => 4? Wait, top non-zero is 0 from layer1, skip; next is 4 from layer2, so 4. Output row1 col3: 4. Yes.\n\nColumn4: 5, 0, 0, 8 => 5. Output col4: 5. Yes.\n\nColumn5: 5, 4, 0, 8 => 5. Output col5: 5. Yes.\n\nColumn6: 5, 0, 0, 8 => 5. Output col6: 5. Yes.\n\nMatches output row1: 5 5 4 5 5 5.\n\nOutput row2: use rows 2, 5, 8, 11:\n\nRow2: 0 5 0 5 0 5\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 0 4\nRow8: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow11: 0 0 8 8 8 8\n\nOverlay:\n\nColumn1: 0, 0, 0, 0 => 0. Output col1: 0. Yes.\n\nColumn2: 5, 0, 2, 0 => 5. Output col2: 5. Yes.\n\nColumn3: 0, 0, 2, 8 => 2? Wait, top non-zero: 0, 0, 2 => 2. Output col3: 8? Wait output row2 col3 is 8. Let's check output row2: 0 5 8 5 8 5. So col3 is 8, not 2. Let's re-evaluate: Did we misalign? Wait, output row2 col3 is 8. So maybe the overlay rule is different? Let's re-evaluate carefully.\n\nLet's re-check Example 2 output row2: \"0 5 8 5 8 5\". So col3 = 8. But our overlay gave 2. Let's check input rows again: Row2 (layer1 row2) = 0 5 0 5 0 5. Row5 (layer2 row2) = 0 0 0 0 0 4. Row8 (layer3 row2) = 0 2 2 0 2 0. Row11 (layer4 row2) = 0 0 8 8 8 8. So for column3: values: 0 (row2 col3), 0 (row5 col3), 2 (row8 col3), 8 (row11 col3). The first non-zero is 2. But output says 8. So overlay rule fails for column3. Let's check column5: values: 0, 0, 2, 8 => first non-zero 2, but output row2 col5 = 8. So overlay fails again. So maybe we misinterpreted the mapping of layers? Maybe the output rows correspond to some other mapping of input rows: maybe output row1 uses rows 1, 4, 7, 10; output row2 uses rows 2, 5, 8, 11; output row3 uses rows 3, 6, 9, 12. That we used. But overlay fails for columns 3 and 5. Let's double-check the output row2: maybe we misread output? Example 2 output:\n\nOutput:\n5 5 4 5 5 5\n0 5 8 5 8 5\n2 4 2 5 5 4\n\nWait, hold on. The output for Example 2 is:\n\nRow1: 5 5 4 5 5 5\nRow2: 0 5 8 5 8 5\nRow3: 2 4 2 5 5 4\n\nYes, that's correct. So row2 col3 is 8, row2 col5 is 8.\n\nOur overlay gave 2 for those columns. So maybe we mis-identified the mapping of layers: maybe the 4 layers are not simply the 4 groups of 3 rows. Maybe the 4 layers are something else. But the overlay rule worked perfectly for Example 1. So maybe we misaligned the layers for Example 2. Let's re-examine Example 2 input: Are the colors arranged in vertical bands of 3 rows each? Let's see:\n\nRows 1-3: 5's region? \nRow1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow2: 0 5 0 5 0 5\nRow3: 0 0 0 5 5 0\n\nThese contain 5's and 0's.\n\nRows 4-6: 4's region? \nRow4: 0 4 4 0 4 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 0 4\nRow6: 0 4 0 4 0 4\n\nThese contain 4's and 0's.\n\nRows 7-9: 2's region? \nRow7: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow8: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow9: 2 2 2 0 2 0\n\nThese contain 2's and 0's.\n\nRows 10-12: 8's region? \nRow10: 8 0 8 8 8 8\nRow11: 0 0 8 8 8 8\nRow12: 0 0 0 8 0 0\n\nThese contain 8's and 0's.\n\nSo the layering assumption holds. So why did overlay fail for columns 3 and 5? Let's check again overlay for column3: values from top to bottom: Row1 col3 = 0; Row4 col3 = 4; Row7 col3 = 2; Row10 col3 = 8. Wait, we mis-indexed earlier: we used row5 (layer2 row2) incorrectly. Let's correct: For output row2, we should use row2 of layer1 (row2), row5 of layer2? Wait, row5 is layer2 row2? Actually, layer2 rows are 4-6. So row5 is layer2 row2. Yes. But we used row5 earlier. That is correct. But we need to check column3 values: row2 col3 = 0; row5 col3 = 0; row8 col3 = 2; row11 col3 = 8. But we might have mis-read row5 col3: Row5 is 0 0 0 0 0 4, so col3 is 0. So first non-zero is 2 from row8. So overlay gives 2. But output says 8. So overlay fails.\n\nWait, maybe we mis-ordered the layers: maybe the layers are not 3 rows each but some other grouping. Let's examine the patterns: In Example 1, the 4 layers are clearly 3 rows each. But maybe in Example 2, the 4 layers are also 3 rows each but the overlay rule is different: maybe we overlay but we also consider some other transformation like we \"flip\" some layers horizontally? But that seems unlikely.\n\nLet's examine Example 2 output row2: 0 5 8 5 8 5. This pattern might be derived from overlay of some rotated or mirrored version of layers. Let's analyze each column separately.\n\nColumn1: output 0. Input values from rows 2,5,8,11: 0,0,0,0. So output 0. So no change.\n\nColumn2: output 5. Input values: 5,0,2,0. First non-zero is 5. So overlay matches.\n\nColumn3: output 8. Input values: 0,0,2,8. The first non-zero is 2. So overlay fails. But if we consider the last non-zero (bottommost) instead of first, we get 8. So maybe we take the bottommost non-zero? Let's test for column2: bottommost non-zero is 2 (row8), but output is 5. So not bottommost. Maybe we take the second non-zero? Let's check column3: second non-zero is 8? Actually values: 0,0,2,8. The second non-zero is 8 (since first non-zero is 2). But output is 8. So maybe we take the last non-zero? But column2 would be 2, not 5. So no.\n\nMaybe we take the \"most frequent non-zero\" across the 4 layers? For column3: values: 0,0,2,8. Frequencies: 2 appears 1, 8 appears 1. No majority. So maybe we take the \"largest\" non-zero? 8 > 2, so output 8. For column5: values: 0,0,2,8. Largest is 8. Output 8. For column2: values: 5,0,2,0. Largest is 5. Output 5. For column4: values: 5,0,0,8. Largest is 8? Actually 8 > 5, but output 5. So not largest. Maybe we take \"first non-zero from top to bottom\" but with some special rule for columns where the topmost non-zero is 0? Wait, column4: values: row2 col4 = 5 (non-zero). So first non-zero is 5. Output 5. So that matches overlay. Column5: values: row2 col5 = 0, row5 col5 = 0, row8 col5 = 2, row11 col5 = 8. First non-zero is 2, but output 8. So overlay fails.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: For each column, if the first non-zero is not 5? But column5 first non-zero is 2, but output is 8. So maybe we choose the \"last non-zero\" for columns where the topmost non-zero is not 5? That seems arbitrary.\n\nLet's examine Example 3 to see if overlay works or not. Example 3 output row1: 5 8 5 4 8 4. Let's test overlay with top-to-bottom across 4 layers. Input rows 1,4,7,10: \nRow1: 5 0 5 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 4 0 4\nRow7: 0 0 2 0 0 2\nRow10: 8 8 0 8 8 8\n\nOverlay column by column:\n\nCol1: 5,0,0,8 => first non-zero: 5. Output col1: 5. Yes.\n\nCol2: 0,0,0,8 => first non-zero: 8. Output col2: 8. Yes.\n\nCol3: 5,0,2,0 => first non-zero: 5. Output col3: 5. Yes.\n\nCol4: 0,4,0,8 => first non-zero: 4. Output col4: 4. Yes.\n\nCol5: 0,0,0,8 => first non-zero: 8. Output col5: 8. Yes.\n\nCol6: 0,4,2,8 => first non-zero: 4. Output col6: 4. Yes.\n\nMatches output row1. Good.\n\nOutput row2: 8 8 5 4 8 5. Input rows 2,5,8,11: \nRow2: 0 0 5 0 0 5\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 0 0\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 2 0\nRow11: 8 8 8 8 8 0\n\nOverlay:\n\nCol1: 0,0,2,8 => first non-zero: 2. Output col1: 8? Wait output row2 col1 = 8. So overlay fails again. Let's double-check: Row2 col1 = 0. Row5 col1 = 0. Row8 col1 = 2. Row11 col1 = 8. So first non-zero is 2. But output is 8. So overlay fails.\n\nBut maybe we mis-identified the mapping: For output row2, maybe we should use input rows 2,5,8,11? That we did. But overlay fails for col1. Let's examine the pattern: Output row2: 8 8 5 4 8 5. Let's check each column:\n\nColumn1: output 8. Input values: 0,0,2,8. The last non-zero is 8. Column2: output 8. Input values: 0,0,2,8. Last non-zero is 8. Column3: output 5. Input values: 5,0,0,8. First non-zero is 5. Column4: output 4. Input values: 0,4,2,8. First non-zero is 4. Column5: output 8. Input values: 0,0,2,8. Last non-zero is 8. Column6: output 5. Input values: 5,0,0,0. First non-zero is 5.\n\nSo for columns 1 and 2 and 5, we took the last non-zero (bottommost). For columns 3,4,6 we took the first non-zero. So it's not consistent.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For each column, if the first non-zero is 0, we go to the next non-zero? But that still would be 2 for column1. Wait, the first non-zero is 0? Actually 0 is not non-zero. So we skip zeros until we find a non-zero. That gives 2. But output is 8. So maybe we skip zeros and then if the next non-zero is 2, we skip again? That would be weird.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the layers are not stacked vertically but horizontally? Maybe we overlay columns instead of rows? Let's think: The output grid is 3x6. Input is 12x6. We might be combining the 4 layers in some way to produce 3 rows. We used overlay across vertical stacking. That worked for Example 1 and 3 but not for 2 and 6? Wait, we didn't test Example 6. Let's test Example 6 overlay: Input rows 1,4,7,10: \nRow1: 0 5 0 5 5 0\nRow4: 4 0 0 0 4 4\nRow7: 0 2 2 2 2 0\nRow10: 8 0 0 8 0 8\n\nOverlay:\n\nCol1: 0,4,0,8 => first non-zero: 4. Output row1 col1: 4. Yes.\n\nCol2: 5,0,2,0 => first non-zero: 5. Output col2: 5. Yes.\n\nCol3: 0,0,2,0 => first non-zero: 2. Output col3: 2. Yes.\n\nCol4: 5,0,2,8 => first non-zero: 5. Output col4: 5. Yes.\n\nCol5: 5,4,2,0 => first non-zero: 5. Output col5: 5. Yes.\n\nCol6: 0,4,0,8 => first non-zero: 4. Output col6: 4. Yes.\n\nMatches output row1: 4 5 2 5 5 4. Good.\n\nOutput row2: use rows 2,5,8,11:\n\nRow2: 0 5 0 5 5 5\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 4 0\nRow8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow11: 8 0 0 0 8 0\n\nOverlay:\n\nCol1: 0,0,2,8 => first non-zero: 2. Output col1: 8? Wait output row2 col1 is 8. So overlay fails.\n\nLet's double-check row2 col1: Row2 col1 = 0. Row5 col1 = 0. Row8 col1 = 2. Row11 col1 = 8. So first non-zero is 2, but output is 8. So overlay fails for column1. Column2: values: 5,0,2,0 => first non-zero: 5. Output col2: 5. Yes. Column3: values: 0,0,2,0 => first non-zero: 2. Output col3: 2. Yes. Column4: values: 5,4,0,0 => first non-zero: 5. Output col4: 5. Yes. Column5: values: 5,4,2,8 => first non-zero: 5. Output col5: 5. Yes. Column6: values: 5,0,0,0 => first non-zero: 5. Output col6: 5. Yes.\n\nSo overlay fails only for column1 of output row2, where output is 8 but overlay would give 2. Column1 of output row3: we need to check.\n\nOutput row3: 5 5 4 5 5 5. Input rows 3,6,9,12:\n\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow6: 4 0 0 0 0 0\nRow9: 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow12: 0 8 0 8 0 0\n\nOverlay:\n\nCol1: 5,4,0,0 => first non-zero: 5. Output col1: 5. Yes.\nCol2: 5,0,0,8 => first non-zero: 5. Output col2: 5. Yes.\nCol3: 0,0,0,0 => 0. Output col3: 4? Wait output row3 col3 is 4. But overlay gives 0. So overlay fails again. Let's double-check: Row3 col3 = 0. Row6 col3 = 0. Row9 col3 = 0. Row12 col3 = 0. So all zeros. But output row3 col3 is 4. So overlay fails.\n\nSo overlay fails for some columns in Example 2 and Example 6. But overlay works for Example 1 and Example 3. So maybe the rule is something else that we need to discover.\n\nLet's examine Example 2 and Example 6 more closely. Maybe the rule is not overlay of the 4 layers but something like \"for each cell, choose the color that appears in the majority of the 4 layers\" but with some tie-breaking. Let's test that.\n\nExample 2, output row2 col3: 8. Input values: 0,0,2,8. Frequencies: 0 appears 2 times, 2 appears 1, 8 appears 1. Majority is 0, but output is 8. So not majority.\n\nMaybe we choose the color that appears in the bottom layer if the top layers have zeros? Let's test: For col3, top layers 0,0,2,8. Topmost non-zero is 2 (layer3). But output is 8 (layer4). So maybe we choose bottommost non-zero if there are zeros in the topmost non-zero? That seems arbitrary.\n\nMaybe we choose the color that appears in the \"center\" of the 4 layers? But we need to formalize.\n\nLet's examine Example 2 output row2 col3 (8). The layers for that column: 0 (layer1), 0 (layer2), 2 (layer3), 8 (layer4). The output picks 8 (layer4). Example 2 output row2 col5 (8). Layers: 0,0,2,8. Output picks 8. Example 2 output row2 col1 (0). Layers: 0,0,0,0. Output picks 0. Example 2 output row2 col2 (5). Layers: 5,0,2,0. Output picks 5 (layer1). Example 2 output row2 col4 (5). Layers: 5,0,0,8. Output picks 5 (layer1). Example 2 output row2 col6 (5). Layers: 5,0,0,8. Output picks 5 (layer1). So for columns where the topmost non-zero is not 0, we choose that. For columns where topmost non-zero is 0 (i.e., top two layers are 0), we choose the bottommost non-zero (layer4). But that fails for column3: topmost non-zero is 2 (layer3), not 0, but output picks 8 (layer4). So that rule fails.\n\nLet's examine Example 6 output row2 col1: 8. Layers: 0,0,2,8. Topmost non-zero is 2 (layer3). Output picks 8. So again, same pattern: topmost non-zero is 2 but output picks bottommost non-zero.\n\nBut in other columns, topmost non-zero is 5 (layer1) and output picks 5. So maybe the rule is: For each column, if the topmost non-zero is 2, we skip it and take the next non-zero? Let's test: For Example 2, col3: topmost non-zero is 2 (layer3). Next non-zero is 8 (layer4). Output picks 8. For col5: topmost non-zero is 2 (layer3). Next non-zero is 8. Output picks 8. For col1: topmost non-zero is 0? Actually topmost non-zero is 0? Wait, topmost non-zero is 0? There is no non-zero until layer4 (8). But topmost non-zero is 8. But there is no 2. So output picks 8. For col2: topmost non-zero is 5 (layer1). No 2. So output picks 5. For col4: topmost non-zero is 5 (layer1). Output picks 5. For col6: topmost non-zero is 5. Output picks 5.\n\nSo rule: For each column, if the topmost non-zero is 2, then skip it and take the next non-zero. But what if there is no next non-zero? Then we take 2? But in Example 6, col1: topmost non-zero is 2 (layer3). Next non-zero is 8 (layer4). Output picks 8. In Example 6, col3: topmost non-zero is 2 (layer3). Next non-zero is 0? Wait, col3: values: 0,0,2,0. Topmost non-zero is 2. Next non-zero? There is none (layer4 is 0). So rule would pick 2. But output col3 is 2. That matches. So rule: if topmost non-zero is 2 and there is a subsequent non-zero, pick the next non-zero; else keep 2. But let's test this rule on Example 2 output row2 col3: topmost non-zero is 2. Next non-zero is 8. Output picks 8. Good. Example 2 output row2 col5: same. Example 2 output row2 col1: topmost non-zero is 8 (layer4). No 2 at top. So output picks 8. Good. Example 2 output row2 col2: topmost non-zero is 5. Output picks 5. Good. Example 2 output row2 col4: topmost non-zero is 5. Output picks 5. Good. Example 2 output row2 col6: topmost non-zero is 5. Output picks 5. Good.\n\nNow test this rule on Example 6 output row2 col1: topmost non-zero is 2 (layer3). Next non-zero is 8 (layer4). Output picks 8. Good. Output row2 col3: topmost non-zero is 2 (layer3). Next non-zero is none. Output picks 2. Good. Output row2 col4: topmost non-zero is 5 (layer1). Output picks 5. Good. Output row2 col5: topmost non-zero is 5 (layer1). Output picks 5. Good. Output row2 col6: topmost non-zero is 5 (layer1). Output picks 5. Good.\n\nNow test this rule on Example 6 output row3: 5 5 4 5 5 5. Let's compute for each column:\n\nInput rows for output row3: rows 3,6,9,12: \nRow3: 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow6: 4 0 0 0 0 0\nRow9: 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow12: 0 8 0 8 0 0\n\nNow for each column:\n\nCol1: values: 5,4,0,0. Topmost non-zero is 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol2: 5,0,0,8. Topmost non-zero is 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol3: 0,0,0,0. Topmost non-zero is none. Output 0? But output row3 col3 is 4. Wait, output row3 col3 is 4. So our rule fails for col3. Let's re-check input: Row3 col3 = 0. Row6 col3 = 0. Row9 col3 = 0. Row12 col3 = 0. All zeros. So how can output be 4? So maybe we mis-identified the mapping for output row3? Maybe output row3 uses different rows? Wait, maybe the output rows correspond to the layers but not in the same order. Maybe output row1 uses layer1, output row2 uses layer2, output row3 uses layer3? But that would produce 3 rows from 3 layers, ignoring the bottom layer. But we saw overlay fails for some columns. But maybe the mapping is different: maybe output row1 uses rows 1,4,7,10; output row2 uses rows 2,5,8,11; output row3 uses rows 3,6,9,12. That we used. That produced overlay for Example 1 and 3 but not for Example 2 and 6. But maybe for Example 6 output row3 col3 is 4, but we got 0. So overlay fails. So maybe the mapping is not that.\n\nLet's check Example 6 output row3 again: 5 5 4 5 5 5. Let's try overlay with other mapping: maybe output row3 uses rows 3,6,9,12 but we mis-copied output row3: It's 5 5 4 5 5 5. Yes.\n\nNow let's check if maybe output row3 col3 is 4 because there is a 4 in layer2 row3 (row6 col3) is 0, but layer2 row2 col3 is 0, etc. Wait, row6 col3 is 0. But maybe we mis-copied input? Let's double-check Example 6 input row6: 4 0 4 0 0 4. Actually row6 is \"4 0 4 0 0 4\" from the input: \"4 0 4 0 0 4\". Wait, earlier we had row6 as \"4 0 0 0 0 0\" incorrectly. Let's re-read Example 6 input carefully:\n\nExample 6 Input:\n0 5 0 5 5 0\n0 5 0 5 5 5\n5 5 0 5 5 5\n4 0 0 0 4 4\n0 0 0 4 4 0\n4 0 4 0 0 4\n0 2 2 2 2 0\n2 2 2 0 2 0\n0 2 0 2 0 0\n8 0 0 8 0 8\n8 0 0 0 8 0\n8 0 0 8 0 0\n\nLet's double-check each row:\n\nRow1: 0 5 0 5 5 0\nRow2: 0 5 0 5 5 5\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow4: 4 0 0 0 4 4\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 4 0\nRow6: 4 0 4 0 0 4\nRow7: 0 2 2 2 2 0\nRow8: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow9: 0 2 0 2 0 0\nRow10: 8 0 0 8 0 8\nRow11: 8 0 0 0 8 0\nRow12: 8 0 0 8 0 0\n\nWe earlier mis-copied row6 as \"4 0 0 0 0 0\" but correct is \"4 0 4 0 0 4\". So let's recompute overlay for Example 6 output row3:\n\nOutput row3: 5 5 4 5 5 5.\n\nInput rows for output row3: rows 3,6,9,12:\n\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow6: 4 0 4 0 0 4\nRow9: 0 2 0 2 0 0\nRow12: 8 0 0 8 0 0\n\nNow overlay:\n\nCol1: 5,4,0,8 => first non-zero: 5. Output col1: 5. Good.\n\nCol2: 5,0,2,0 => first non-zero: 5. Output col2: 5. Good.\n\nCol3: 0,4,0,0 => first non-zero: 4. Output col3: 4. Good.\n\nCol4: 5,0,2,8 => first non-zero: 5. Output col4: 5. Good.\n\nCol5: 0,0,0,0 => 0. Output col5: 5? Wait output col5 is 5. So overlay fails. Let's double-check row3 col5: 0. Row6 col5: 0. Row9 col5: 0. Row12 col5: 0. So all zeros. But output row3 col5 is 5. So overlay fails.\n\nWait, maybe we mis-copied output row3 col5? Let's re-check Example 6 output:\n\nOutput:\n4 5 2 5 5 4\n8 5 2 5 5 5\n5 5 4 5 5 5\n\nSo output row3 col5 is 5 indeed. So overlay fails for column5. Let's examine column5: input values: Row3 col5 = 0, Row6 col5 = 0, Row9 col5 = 0, Row12 col5 = 0. All zeros. But output has 5. So maybe we mis-copied input row6 col5: row6 col5 is 0? Wait, row6 is \"4 0 4 0 0 4\". So col5 is 0. Row9 is \"0 2 0 2 0 0\". So col5 is 0. Row12 is \"8 0 0 8 0 0\". So col5 is 0. So indeed all zeros. So output cannot be 5. So maybe the mapping is not rows 3,6,9,12. Maybe output row3 uses rows 3,6,9,12 but we mis-copied output row3 incorrectly? Let's double-check Example 6 output: Provided:\n\nOutput:\n4 5 2 5 5 4\n8 5 2 5 5 5\n5 5 4 5 5 5\n\nYes, output row3 col5 is 5. So overlay fails.\n\nThus the overlay rule cannot be simply \"first non-zero from top to bottom\" for all examples. It works for some but not all. Let's examine more systematically.\n\nWe need to identify the transformation rule that explains all examples.\n\nObservations:\n\n- Input is always 12x6.\n- Output is always 3x6.\n- Colors present: 0,2,4,5,8.\n- The input appears to have 4 layers of 3 rows each, each layer dominated by one color: 5,4,2,8 respectively. The layers may have some pattern within each color group. The layers appear to be arranged vertically in the input: top 3 rows are color 5, next 3 rows color 4, next 3 rows color 2, bottom 3 rows color 8.\n\n- The output seems to combine the 4 layers in some way to produce a 3x6 grid.\n\n- In Example 1, the output uses only colors 5,4,2,0, no 8. In Example 2, output uses all colors including 8. In Example 3, output uses all colors including 8. In Example 4, output uses 5,4,8? Wait, Example 4 output: \nRow1: 5 5 5 5 4 4\nRow2: 8 5 5 4 5 5\nRow3: 4 5 5 5 5 5\n\nSo output uses 5,4,8. No 2 or 0? Wait, output row1: 5 5 5 5 4 4. Row2: 8 5 5 4 5 5. Row3: 4 5 5 5 5 5. So output uses 5,4,8. No 2 or 0. So maybe the output uses only the colors from the top 3 layers? But Example 4 has top layers: 5,4,? Wait, top 3 layers: 5,4,? Actually top 3 layers: 5 (rows 1-3), 4 (rows 4-6), 2 (rows 7-9). So output uses 5,4,2? But output doesn't have 2. So not top 3 layers.\n\nBut maybe the output uses only the colors that appear in the input's top 3 layers (5,4,2). But Example 4 output uses 8, which is bottom layer. So that fails.\n\nLet's examine Example 4 input to see if there is any pattern: Input rows 1-12:\n\nRow1: 5 5 5 5 0 0\nRow2: 0 5 5 0 5 5\nRow3: 0 5 5 5 5 5\nRow4: 4 4 4 0 4 4\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 4 0\nRow6: 4 4 4 0 4 0\nRow7: 2 0 2 2 0 0\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 0 0\nRow9: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow10: 0 0 8 0 8 8\nRow11: 8 8 8 0 0 0\nRow12: 0 8 0 0 8 0\n\nSo top 3 layers: 5,4,2. Bottom layer: 8.\n\nOutput: 3x6: \nRow1: 5 5 5 5 4 4\nRow2: 8 5 5 4 5 5\nRow3: 4 5 5 5 5 5\n\nSo output uses colors 5,4,8. No 2 or 0. So maybe the rule is: combine layers but with some transformation that removes some colors based on some property. For Example 4, the 2's layer may be removed or replaced with something else.\n\nLet's examine Example 5 input:\n\nInput rows 1-12:\n\nRow1: 5 0 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 5 0 0 0 5\nRow3: 0 0 5 5 5 0\nRow4: 4 4 0 4 4 4\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 4 0\nRow6: 4 0 4 4 0 0\nRow7: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 2 0\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 0 2\nRow10: 8 8 8 8 0 8\nRow11: 0 0 0 8 8 0\nRow12: 0 0 0 8 8 8\n\nOutput: \nRow1: 5 4 8 4 4 4\nRow2: 2 5 0 4 4 5\nRow3: 4 0 5 5 5 8\n\nOutput uses 5,4,8,2,0. So all colors present. So no removal.\n\nExample 6 output uses 5,4,8,2? Let's check: output row1: 4 5 2 5 5 4 includes 4,5,2. Output row2: 8 5 2 5 5 5 includes 8,5,2. Output row3: 5 5 4 5 5 5 includes 5,4. So output uses 5,4,8,2. So all colors present.\n\nSo the only example where a color is missing from output is Example 4, where 2 and 0 are missing. In Example 4, the 2's layer is maybe \"blank\" or something? Let's check Example 4 input's 2's layer (rows 7-9): \nRow7: 2 0 2 2 0 0\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 0 0\nRow9: 2 2 2 0 2 0\n\nThe 2's layer has many 2's and zeros. The output doesn't contain any 2's. So maybe the rule is: if a layer has some property, we discard it. But what property? Let's examine each layer across examples.\n\nWe can attempt to find a rule that for each column picks a value from one of the layers based on some property of that column across layers. For each column, we need to decide which layer's value to take for that column. In Example 1, the rule appears to be \"first non-zero from top to bottom\" (i.e., choose the topmost non-zero). That yields output that includes 5,4,2. But no 8 because bottom layer 8 never appears above zeros in any column? Wait, let's check Example 1 columns: For each column, we saw overlay gave output values: For column1, topmost non-zero is 2 (layer3). For column2, topmost non-zero is 5 (layer1). For column3, topmost non-zero is 5. For column4, topmost non-zero is 5. For column5, topmost non-zero is 5. For column6, topmost non-zero is 2. So bottom layer 8 never appears because there is no column where the topmost non-zero is 8? Let's check: For each column, check if any topmost non-zero is 8: In column1, topmost non-zero is 2. In column2, topmost non-zero is 5. In column3, topmost non-zero is 5. In column4, topmost non-zero is 5. In column5, topmost non-zero is 5. In column6, topmost non-zero is 2. So indeed, the bottom layer 8 never appears. So output uses only 5,4,2. That matches the rule: choose topmost non-zero. So Example 1 fits that rule.\n\nExample 2: If we apply the same rule \"first non-zero from top to bottom\", we get a different output than given. Let's compute overlay for Example 2 again to see what we get.\n\nWe already computed overlay for Example 2 output row1 and row3: those matched the given output. But for output row2, overlay gave different values for columns 3,5, maybe others. Let's recompute overlay for Example 2 output row2 carefully:\n\nInput rows for output row2: rows 2,5,8,11.\n\nRow2: 0 5 0 5 0 5\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 0 4\nRow8: 0 2 2 0 2 0\nRow11: 0 0 8 8 8 8\n\nNow overlay:\n\nCol1: 0,0,0,0 => 0. Output row2 col1: 0. Good.\n\nCol2: 5,0,2,0 => 5. Output col2: 5. Good.\n\nCol3: 0,0,2,8 => 2. Output col3: 8. So mismatch.\n\nCol4: 5,0,0,8 => 5. Output col4: 5. Good.\n\nCol5: 0,0,2,8 => 2. Output col5: 8. Mismatch.\n\nCol6: 5,4,0,8 => 5. Output col6: 5. Good.\n\nSo overlay fails for columns 3 and 5. In those columns, the topmost non-zero is 2 (layer3). But output picks 8 (layer4). So maybe the rule is: For each column, if the topmost non-zero is 2, skip it and take the next non-zero. But that would produce 8 for those columns. That matches output. For column3 and 5, we skip 2 and take 8. For column2, topmost non-zero is 5, we don't skip. For column4, topmost non-zero is 5, we don't skip. For column6, topmost non-zero is 5, we don't skip. For column1, topmost non-zero is 0 (none), so we pick 0. So that rule works for Example 2.\n\nLet's test this rule on Example 6 output row2. We already did: For column1, topmost non-zero is 2 (layer3). Skip it, next non-zero is 8. Output col1: 8. Good. For column3, topmost non-zero is 2, next non-zero is none, so output 2. Output col3: 2. Good. For column2, topmost non-zero is 5, not 2, so output 5. Good. For column4, topmost non-zero is 5, output 5. For column5, topmost non-zero is 5, output 5. For column6, topmost non-zero is 5, output 5. So rule works for Example 6 output row2.\n\nNow test rule on Example 6 output row3. Input rows 3,6,9,12:\n\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow6: 4 0 4 0 0 4\nRow9: 0 2 0 2 0 0\nRow12: 8 0 0 8 0 0\n\nNow for each column:\n\nCol1: 5,4,0,8 => topmost non-zero is 5. Not 2, so output 5. Output row3 col1: 5. Good.\n\nCol2: 5,0,2,0 => topmost non-zero is 5. Not 2. Output 5. Output row3 col2: 5. Good.\n\nCol3: 0,4,0,0 => topmost non-zero is 4. Not 2. Output 4. Output row3 col3: 4. Good.\n\nCol4: 5,0,2,8 => topmost non-zero is 5. Not 2. Output 5. Output row3 col4: 5. Good.\n\nCol5: 0,0,0,0 => topmost non-zero is none (0). Output 0? But output row3 col5 is 5. So rule fails. But maybe we mis-copied output row3 col5: Wait, output row3 col5 is 5. Yes. But input col5 all zeros. So how could output be 5? That means rule cannot be based solely on overlay of these layers. There must be some other transformation.\n\nBut maybe we mis-identified the mapping for output row3: maybe output row3 uses rows 3,6,9,12? We used that. But maybe output row3 uses rows 3,6,9,12 but we mis-copied input row6? Wait, we had row6 col5 = 0. Row9 col5 = 0. Row12 col5 = 0. So indeed all zeros. So overlay would produce 0. But output row3 col5 is 5. So maybe the rule is not overlay at all, but something else that can produce a non-zero in a column where all layers have zero. That suggests maybe the output is not derived by overlay of the layers but by some other transformation that uses the pattern of colors across the layers.\n\nMaybe the output is a 3x6 grid that is the \"difference\" between the layers? For example, maybe we compute the \"majority\" color for each column across the 4 layers, but we treat zeros as \"no color\" and we choose the most frequent non-zero color? Let's test that for Example 6 output row3 col5: All zeros, so no non-zero color. So maybe we choose some default color like 5? But why 5? Not sure.\n\nLet's analyze Example 4 output row3 col5: output row3 col5 is 5. Input rows 3,6,9,12: \nRow3: 0 5 5 5 5 5\nRow6: 4 4 4 0 4 0\nRow9: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow12: 0 8 0 8 0 0\n\nColumn5: Row3 col5 = 5, Row6 col5 = 4, Row9 col5 = 2, Row12 col5 = 0. So overlay would give 5. Output row3 col5 is 5. So overlay matches there. But we had a mismatch for Example 6 output row3 col5. Let's double-check Example 6 input rows 3,6,9,12: maybe row6 col5 is not 0? Wait, row6 is \"4 0 4 0 0 4\". So col5 is 0. Row9 is \"0 2 0 2 0 0\". So col5 is 0. Row12 is \"8 0 0 8 0 0\". So col5 is 0. So indeed all zeros. So overlay would give 0. But output row3 col5 is 5. So rule fails.\n\nLet's re-examine Example 6 output row3 col5: The output row3 is \"5 5 4 5 5 5\". So col5 is 5. So there must be some other rule that chooses 5 for that column.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For each column, we take the color that appears most frequently among the layers, but if there is a tie or no non-zero, we choose a default color (maybe 5). But in Example 6 output row3 col5, all zeros, so no non-zero. So maybe we choose 5 as default. But why 5? Because 5 is the dominant color overall? But 5 is the top layer color. But we need to check other columns where there is no non-zero but output is not 5. Are there any such columns in other examples? Let's check Example 2 output row2 col1: all zeros across layers, output 0. So not default 5. So maybe the default is 0. But then why Example 6 output row3 col5 is 5? Let's check again: maybe we mis-copied Example 6 output row3 col5. Let's re-check Example 6 output from the problem statement:\n\nExample 6 Output:\n4 5 2 5 5 4\n8 5 2 5 5 5\n5 5 4 5 5 5\n\nSo row3: 5 5 4 5 5 5. Yes, col5 is 5. So indeed output row3 col5 is 5. But input rows 3,6,9,12 all zeros in col5. So overlay fails.\n\nLet's re-check Example 6 input row6 col5: row6 is \"4 0 4 0 0 4\". So col5 is 0. Row9 col5: \"0 2 0 2 0 0\". So col5 is 0. Row12 col5: \"8 0 0 8 0 0\". So col5 is 0. So all zeros. So how did output get 5? Let's examine Example 6 output row3 col5: 5. That suggests that maybe we didn't align the layers correctly. Maybe the mapping from input to output is not row3,6,9,12 but something else. Let's consider that maybe output row1 uses rows 1,4,7,10; output row2 uses rows 2,5,8,11; output row3 uses rows 3,6,9,12. That we used. But maybe the mapping is different: maybe output row1 uses rows 1,5,9,13? But there is no row13. But maybe output row1 uses rows 1,4,7,10; output row2 uses rows 2,5,8,11; output row3 uses rows 3,6,9,12. That seems natural.\n\nBut maybe we mis-copied input row6: Wait, row6 is \"4 0 4 0 0 4\". So col5 is 0. So indeed all zeros. So output row3 col5 cannot be derived by overlay of those layers. So maybe the rule is not overlay of rows but something else.\n\nLet's analyze Example 4 output again: output row3 col5 is 5. Input rows 3,6,9,12: we computed overlay gave 5. So that matched. So overlay works for Example 4 row3 col5. But for Example 6 row3 col5 overlay fails. So maybe the difference is that in Example 6, the 5's layer (top) might be \"broken\" in some way? Let's check Example 6 top layer rows 1-3:\n\nRow1: 0 5 0 5 5 0\nRow2: 0 5 0 5 5 5\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 5 5\n\nSo top layer has 5's in many positions. For column5, top layer row1 col5 = 5, row2 col5 = 5, row3 col5 = 5. So top layer has 5 in column5. So overlay would have 5 as topmost non-zero for column5. But we used input rows 3,6,9,12 for output row3. But maybe output row3 uses rows 3,6,9,12 but the top layer for column5 is row3? Wait, top layer row3 col5 = 5. So overlay for column5 would be 5. But we considered input rows 3,6,9,12, which includes row3 col5 = 5. Wait, earlier we incorrectly considered row3 col5 as 0. Let's re-check: Input row3 col5: row3 is \"5 5 0 5 5 5\". So col5 is 5. So earlier we mis-copied input row3 col5 as 0. That was a mistake. So overlay for column5 of output row3 should be 5. Let's recompute overlay for Example 6 output row3:\n\nInput rows 3,6,9,12:\n\nRow3: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow6: 4 0 4 0 0 4\nRow9: 0 2 0 2 0 0\nRow12: 8 0 0 8 0 0\n\nNow overlay:\n\nCol1: 5,4,0,8 => first non-zero: 5. Output col1: 5. Yes.\n\nCol2: 5,0,2,0 => first non-zero: 5. Output col2: 5. Yes.\n\nCol3: 0,4,0,0 => first non-zero: 4. Output col3: 4. Yes.\n\nCol4: 5,0,2,8 => first non-zero: 5. Output col4: 5. Yes.\n\nCol5: 5,0,0,0 => first non-zero: 5. Output col5: 5. Yes.\n\nCol6: 5,4,0,0 => first non-zero: 5. Output col6: 5. Yes.\n\nSo overlay works for Example 6 output row3. So we had mis-copied input row3 earlier. So overlay rule might actually hold for all examples. Let's verify again for Example 5 and Example 4.\n\nExample 5: Let's compute overlay for Example 5 output row1: use rows 1,4,7,10. Input rows:\n\nRow1: 5 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 4 4 0 4 4 4\nRow7: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow10: 8 8 8 8 0 8\n\nOverlay:\n\nCol1: 5,4,2,8 => first non-zero: 5. Output row1 col1: 5. Yes.\n\nCol2: 0,4,0,8 => first non-zero: 4. Output col2: 4. Yes.\n\nCol3: 0,0,2,8 => first non-zero: 2. Output col3: 8? Wait output row1 col3 is 8. But overlay gives 2. So overlay fails. Wait, but maybe we mis-copied output row1 col3: output row1 is \"5 4 8 4 4 4\". So col3 is 8. So overlay gave 2, but output is 8. So overlay fails for Example 5 row1 col3.\n\nBut maybe we mis-identified mapping: maybe output row1 uses rows 1,5,9,13? But no row13. Let's examine Example 5 input again: maybe the layers are not strictly 3 rows each? Let's examine the pattern of colors: In Example 5 input, the 5's appear in rows 1-3? Let's check:\n\nRow1: 5 0 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 5 0 0 0 5\nRow3: 0 0 5 5 5 0\n\nSo 5's appear in rows 1-3. So top layer is 5. Next rows 4-6: 4's appear. Row4: 4 4 0 4 4 4. Row5: 0 0 0 4 4 0. Row6: 4 0 4 4 0 0. So 4's appear in rows 4-6. Next rows 7-9: 2's appear. Row7: 2 0 2 2 0 2. Row8: 2 2 0 2 2 0. Row9: 0 0 0 0 0 2. So 2's appear in rows 7-9. Bottom rows 10-12: 8's appear. Row10: 8 8 8 8 0 8. Row11: 0 0 0 8 8 0. Row12: 0 0 0 8 8 8.\n\nSo layering holds. So output row1 uses rows 1,4,7,10. That we used. But overlay fails for column3. Let's recompute overlay for column3: Input values: row1 col3 = 0; row4 col3 = 0; row7 col3 = 2; row10 col3 = 8. So top non-zero is 2. So overlay would give 2. But output is 8. So overlay fails. But we saw earlier that for Example 2 and Example 6, overlay fails for columns where top non-zero is 2. So maybe the rule is: If top non-zero is 2, skip it and take next non-zero. That would produce 8. That matches output for Example 5 row1 col3. Let's test for other columns: Example 5 output row1 col2 is 4. Input values: row1 col2 = 0; row4 col2 = 4; row7 col2 = 0; row10 col2 = 8. Top non-zero is 4. Not 2, so output 4. Good. Output row1 col4 is 4. Input: row1 col4 = 0; row4 col4 = 4; row7 col4 = 2; row10 col4 = 8. Top non-zero is 4. Output 4. Good. Output row1 col5 is 4. Input: row1 col5 = 0; row4 col5 = 4; row7 col5 = 0; row10 col5 = 0. Top non-zero is 4. Output 4. Good. Output row1 col6 is 4. Input: row1 col6 = 0; row4 col6 = 4; row7 col6 = 2; row10 col6 = 8. Top non-zero is 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nSo rule: For each column, we take the topmost non-zero value, but if that topmost non-zero value is 2, we skip it and take the next non-zero. That explains why column3 output is 8. Let's test this rule for Example 5 output row2. Output row2: 2 5 0 4 4 5. Let's compute input rows for output row2: rows 2,5,8,11:\n\nRow2: 0 5 0 0 0 5\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 4 0\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 2 0\nRow11: 0 0 0 8 8 0\n\nNow for each column:\n\nCol1: 0,0,2,0 => top non-zero: 2. Since it's 2, skip and take next non-zero: 0? Wait, next non-zero is none. So we might output 2? But output row2 col1 is 2. That matches. So rule: if top non-zero is 2 and there is no other non-zero, keep 2. So we keep 2. Good.\n\nCol2: 5,0,2,0 => top non-zero: 5. Not 2. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol3: 0,0,0,0 => no non-zero. Output 0. Good.\n\nCol4: 0,4,2,8 => top non-zero: 4. Not 2. Output 4. Good.\n\nCol5: 0,4,2,8 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nCol6: 5,0,0,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nSo rule holds for Example 5 row2.\n\nNow Example 5 output row3: 4 0 5 5 5 8. Input rows 3,6,9,12:\n\nRow3: 0 0 5 5 5 0\nRow6: 4 0 4 4 0 0\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 0 2\nRow12: 0 0 0 8 8 8\n\nNow for each column:\n\nCol1: 0,4,0,0 => top non-zero: 4. Not 2. Output 4. Good.\n\nCol2: 0,0,0,0 => no non-zero. Output 0. Good.\n\nCol3: 5,4,0,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol4: 5,4,0,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol5: 5,0,0,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol6: 0,0,2,8 => top non-zero: 2. Since it's 2, skip and take next non-zero: 8. Output 8. Good.\n\nSo rule holds for Example 5 row3. Good.\n\nNow Example 4 output row1: 5 5 5 5 4 4. Input rows 1,4,7,10:\n\nRow1: 5 5 5 5 0 0\nRow4: 4 4 4 0 4 4\nRow7: 2 0 2 2 0 0\nRow10: 0 0 8 0 8 8\n\nNow for each column:\n\nCol1: 5,4,2,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol2: 5,4,0,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol3: 5,4,2,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol4: 5,0,2,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol5: 0,4,0,8 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nCol6: 0,4,0,8 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nSo rule holds for Example 4 row1.\n\nExample 4 output row2: 8 5 5 4 5 5. Input rows 2,5,8,11:\n\nRow2: 0 5 5 0 5 5\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 4 0\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 0 0\nRow11: 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nNow for each column:\n\nCol1: 0,0,2,8 => top non-zero: 2. Since it's 2, skip and take next non-zero: 8. Output 8. Good.\n\nCol2: 5,0,2,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol3: 5,0,0,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol4: 0,4,2,0 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nCol5: 5,4,0,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol6: 5,0,0,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nSo rule holds for Example 4 row2.\n\nExample 4 output row3: 4 5 5 5 5 5. Input rows 3,6,9,12:\n\nRow3: 0 5 5 5 5 5\nRow6: 4 4 4 0 4 0\nRow9: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow12: 0 8 0 8 0 0\n\nNow for each column:\n\nCol1: 0,4,2,0 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nCol2: 5,4,2,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol3: 5,4,2,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol4: 5,0,0,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol5: 5,4,2,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol6: 5,0,0,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nSo rule holds for Example 4 row3.\n\nNow Example 3 output row1: 5 8 5 4 8 4. Input rows 1,4,7,10:\n\nRow1: 5 0 5 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 4 0 4\nRow7: 0 0 2 0 0 2\nRow10: 8 8 0 8 8 8\n\nNow for each column:\n\nCol1: 5,0,0,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol2: 0,0,0,8 => top non-zero: 8. Output 8. Good.\n\nCol3: 5,0,2,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol4: 0,4,0,8 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nCol5: 0,0,0,8 => top non-zero: 8. Output 8. Good.\n\nCol6: 0,4,2,8 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nSo rule holds for Example 3 row1.\n\nExample 3 output row2: 8 8 5 4 8 5. Input rows 2,5,8,11:\n\nRow2: 0 0 5 0 0 5\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 0 0\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 2 0\nRow11: 8 8 8 8 8 0\n\nNow for each column:\n\nCol1: 0,0,2,8 => top non-zero: 2. Since it's 2, skip and take next non-zero: 8. Output 8. Good.\n\nCol2: 0,0,2,8 => top non-zero: 2. Skip, next non-zero: 8. Output 8. Good.\n\nCol3: 5,0,0,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol4: 0,4,2,8 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nCol5: 0,0,2,8 => top non-zero: 2. Skip, next non-zero: 8. Output 8. Good.\n\nCol6: 5,0,0,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nSo rule holds.\n\nExample 3 output row3: 5 8 5 4 5 4. Input rows 3,6,9,12:\n\nRow3: 5 0 5 0 5 0\nRow6: 4 0 0 4 0 4\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 0 2\nRow12: 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nNow for each column:\n\nCol1: 5,4,0,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol2: 0,0,0,8 => top non-zero: 8. Output 8. Good.\n\nCol3: 5,0,0,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol4: 0,4,0,0 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nCol5: 5,0,0,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol6: 0,4,2,0 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nSo rule holds.\n\nNow Example 2 output row1: 5 5 4 5 5 5. Input rows 1,4,7,10:\n\nRow1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow4: 0 4 4 0 4 0\nRow7: 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow10: 8 0 8 8 8 8\n\nNow for each column:\n\nCol1: 5,0,2,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol2: 5,4,2,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol3: 0,4,2,8 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nCol4: 5,0,0,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol5: 5,4,0,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol6: 5,0,0,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nSo rule holds.\n\nExample 2 output row3: 2 4 2 5 5 4. Input rows 3,6,9,12:\n\nRow3: 0 0 0 5 5 0\nRow6: 0 4 0 4 0 4\nRow9: 2 2 2 0 2 0\nRow12: 0 0 0 8 0 0\n\nNow for each column:\n\nCol1: 0,0,2,0 => top non-zero: 2. Output 2. Good.\n\nCol2: 0,4,2,0 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nCol3: 0,0,2,0 => top non-zero: 2. Output 2. Good.\n\nCol4: 5,4,0,8 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol5: 5,0,2,0 => top non-zero: 5. Output 5. Good.\n\nCol6: 0,4,0,0 => top non-zero: 4. Output 4. Good.\n\nSo rule holds.\n\nThus the rule seems to be: For each output cell, we consider the corresponding column across the four layers (rows 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12). For each column, we take the first non-zero value from the top layer to bottom. However, if that first non-zero value is 2, we skip it and take the next non-zero value. If there is no other non-zero after skipping 2, we keep 2. That is the rule. In other words, we treat the value 2 as a \"placeholder\" that is ignored unless no other non-zero appears in that column. That matches all examples.\n\nLet's test this rule on all examples to ensure no contradictions:\n\n- Example 1: For each column, the first non-zero from top is not 2 except for columns 1 and 6 where it is 2. In those columns, there is no other non-zero after 2? Let's check: Column1: 2 (layer3). Next layers: layer4 has 0. So we keep 2. Column6: 2 (layer3). Next layer: layer4 has 0. So we keep 2. So output matches.\n\n- Example 2: We already tested.\n\n- Example 3: We tested.\n\n- Example 4: We tested.\n\n- Example 5: We tested.\n\n- Example 6: We tested.\n\nThus the rule holds for all examples.\n\nNow we need to apply this rule to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow1: 5 0 5 0 0 5\nRow2: 0 5 0 0 0 5\nRow3: 5 5 5 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 4 0 4\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow6: 4 0 0 4 0 0\nRow7: 2 0 2 0 2 2\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 2 2\nRow9: 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow10: 0 0 8 8 0 0\nRow11: 0 8 0 0 8 8\nRow12: 0 0 0 8 0 0\n\nWe need to produce a 3x6 output.\n\nWe need to determine the mapping: output row1 uses input rows 1,4,7,10; output row2 uses rows 2,5,8,11; output row3 uses rows 3,6,9,12. Let's confirm that this mapping is correct. In all examples, this mapping gave correct results. So we will use that.\n\nThus we need to compute for each column (1-6) the first non-zero from top to bottom among the four values: (row1, row4, row7, row10) for output row1; (row2, row5, row8, row11) for output row2; (row3, row6, row9, row12) for output row3. But with the rule that if the first non-zero is 2, we skip it and take the next non-zero; if no other non-zero, we keep 2.\n\nLet's compute.\n\nFirst, list the values for each column:\n\nWe'll denote the four layers as:\n\nLayer1: rows 1-3 (top)\nLayer2: rows 4-6 (middle)\nLayer3: rows 7-9 (next)\nLayer4: rows 10-12 (bottom)\n\nWe'll create four lists for each output row:\n\nOutput row1 uses rows 1,4,7,10:\n- Row1 (Layer1 row1)\n- Row4 (Layer2 row1)\n- Row7 (Layer3 row1)\n- Row10 (Layer4 row1)\n\nOutput row2 uses rows 2,5,8,11:\n- Row2 (Layer1 row2)\n- Row5 (Layer2 row2)\n- Row8 (Layer3 row2)\n- Row11 (Layer4 row2)\n\nOutput row3 uses rows 3,6,9,12:\n- Row3 (Layer1 row3)\n- Row6 (Layer2 row3)\n- Row9 (Layer3 row3)\n- Row12 (Layer4 row3)\n\nBut careful: In the mapping, the row indices for each output row correspond to the same row number within each layer. For example, output row1 uses the first row of each layer: rows 1,4,7,10. Output row2 uses second row of each layer: rows 2,5,8,11. Output row3 uses third row of each layer: rows 3,6,9,12. That matches all examples.\n\nThus we need to extract for each output row the values from the corresponding row of each layer. Then apply the rule: find the first non-zero value from top to bottom (layer1 to layer4). If that first non-zero is 2, skip it and take the next non-zero. If there is no other non-zero, keep 2. If the first non-zero is not 2, use it.\n\nThus we need to compute for each column.\n\nLet's write down the input rows:\n\nRow1: 5 0 5 0 0 5\nRow2: 0 5 0 0 0 5\nRow3: 5 5 5 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 4 0 4\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow6: 4 0 0 4 0 0\nRow7: 2 0 2 0 2 2\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 2 2\nRow9: 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow10: 0 0 8 8 0 0\nRow11: 0 8 0 0 8 8\nRow12: 0 0 0 8 0 0\n\nNow, for each output row, we will compute the values:\n\n### Output Row 1:\n\nRows used: Row1, Row4, Row7, Row10.\n\n- Row1: 5 0 5 0 0 5\n- Row4: 0 0 0 4 0 4\n- Row7: 2 0 2 0 2 2\n- Row10: 0 0 8 8 0 0\n\nThus for each column:\n\nCol1: values: 5 (row1), 0 (row4), 2 (row7), 0 (row10). First non-zero: 5. Not 2. So output col1 = 5.\n\nCol2: values: 0, 0, 0, 0. No non-zero. Output col2 = 0.\n\nCol3: values: 5, 0, 2, 8. First non-zero: 5. Not 2. Output col3 = 5.\n\nCol4: values: 0, 4, 0, 8. First non-zero: 4. Not 2. Output col4 = 4.\n\nCol5: values: 0, 0, 2, 0. First non-zero: 2. Since it's 2, skip and look for next non-zero. Next non-zero: none? Actually next values: row10 col5 = 0. So no other non-zero. So output col5 = 2.\n\nCol6: values: 5, 4, 2, 0. First non-zero: 5. Not 2. Output col6 = 5.\n\nSo output row1: [5, 0, 5, 4, 2, 5].\n\n### Output Row 2:\n\nRows used: Row2, Row5, Row8, Row11.\n\n- Row2: 0 5 0 0 0 5\n- Row5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- Row8: 2 2 0 2 2 2\n- Row11: 0 8 0 0 8 8\n\nThus for each column:\n\nCol1: values: 0, 0, 2, 0. First non-zero: 2. Since it's 2, skip to next non-zero. Next non-zero: row11 col1 = 0. So no other non-zero. So output col1 = 2.\n\nCol2: values: 5, 0, 2, 8. First non-zero: 5. Not 2. Output col2 = 5.\n\nCol3: values: 0, 0, 0, 0. No non-zero. Output col3 = 0.\n\nCol4: values: 0, 0, 2, 0. First non-zero: 2. Skip. Next non-zero: row11 col4 = 0. No other non-zero. So output col4 = 2.\n\nCol5: values: 0, 0, 2, 8. First non-zero: 2. Skip. Next non-zero: 8. Output col5 = 8.\n\nCol6: values: 5, 0, 2, 8. First non-zero: 5. Not 2. Output col6 = 5.\n\nSo output row2: [2, 5, 0, 2, 8, 5].\n\n### Output Row 3:\n\nRows used: Row3, Row6, Row9, Row12.\n\n- Row3: 5 5 5 0 0 0\n- Row6: 4 0 0 4 0 0\n- Row9: 2 2 2 2 2 2\n- Row12: 0 0 0 8 0 0\n\nThus for each column:\n\nCol1: values: 5, 4, 2, 0. First non-zero: 5. Not 2. Output col1 = 5.\n\nCol2: values: 5, 0, 2, 0. First non-zero: 5. Output 5.\n\nCol3: values: 5, 0, 2, 0. First non-zero: 5. Output 5.\n\nCol4: values: 0, 4, 2, 8. First non-zero: 4. Output 4.\n\nCol5: values: 0, 0, 2, 0. First non-zero: 2. Since it's 2, skip to next non-zero: row12 col5 = 0. No other non-zero. So output col5 = 2.\n\nCol6: values: 0, 0, 2, 0. First non-zero: 2. Skip. Next non-zero: none. Output col6 = 2.\n\nSo output row3: [5, 5, 5, 4, 2, 2].\n\nThus the output grid should be:\n\nRow1: 5 0 5 4 2 5\nRow2: 2 5 0 2 8 5\nRow3: 5 5 5 4 2 2\n\nBut we need to double-check all columns to ensure no mistakes.\n\nLet's recompute carefully.\n\n#### Output Row1:\n\n- Column1: Row1 col1 = 5, Row4 col1 = 0, Row7 col1 = 2, Row10 col1 = 0. So first non-zero is 5. Output 5.\n\n- Column2: Row1 col2 = 0, Row4 col2 = 0, Row7 col2 = 0, Row10 col2 = 0. So output 0.\n\n- Column3: Row1 col3 = 5, Row4 col3 = 0, Row7 col3 = 2, Row10 col3 = 8. First non-zero: 5. Output 5.\n\n- Column4: Row1 col4 = 0, Row4 col4 = 4, Row7 col4 = 0, Row10 col4 = 8. First non-zero: 4. Output 4.\n\n- Column5: Row1 col5 = 0, Row4 col5 = 0, Row7 col5 = 2, Row10 col5 = 0. First non-zero: 2. Skip, next non-zero: none. Output 2.\n\n- Column6: Row1 col6 = 5, Row4 col6 = 4, Row7 col6 = 2, Row10 col6 = 0. First non-zero: 5. Output 5.\n\nSo row1: 5 0 5 4 2 5. Good.\n\n#### Output Row2:\n\n- Column1: Row2 col1 = 0, Row5 col1 = 0, Row8 col1 = 2, Row11 col1 = 0. First non-zero: 2. Skip, next non-zero: none. Output 2.\n\n- Column2: Row2 col2 = 5, Row5 col2 = 0, Row8 col2 = 2, Row11 col2 = 8. First non-zero: 5. Output 5.\n\n- Column3: Row2 col3 = 0, Row5 col3 = 0, Row8 col3 = 0, Row11 col3 = 0. No non-zero. Output 0.\n\n- Column4: Row2 col4 = 0, Row5 col4 = 0, Row8 col4 = 2, Row11 col4 = 0. First non-zero: 2. Skip, next non-zero: none. Output 2.\n\n- Column5: Row2 col5 = 0, Row5 col5 = 0, Row8 col5 = 2, Row11 col5 = 8. First non-zero: 2. Skip, next non-zero: 8. Output 8.\n\n- Column6: Row2 col6 = 5, Row5 col6 = 0, Row8 col6 = 2, Row11 col6 = 8. First non-zero: 5. Output 5.\n\nSo row2: 2 5 0 2 8 5. Good.\n\n#### Output Row3:\n\n- Column1: Row3 col1 = 5, Row6 col1 = 4, Row9 col1 = 2, Row12 col1 = 0. First non-zero: 5. Output 5.\n\n- Column2: Row3 col2 = 5, Row6 col2 = 0, Row9 col2 = 2, Row12 col2 = 0. First non-zero: 5. Output 5.\n\n- Column3: Row3 col3 = 5, Row6 col3 = 0, Row9 col3 = 2, Row12 col3 = 0. First non-zero: 5. Output 5.\n\n- Column4: Row3 col4 = 0, Row6 col4 = 4, Row9 col4 = 2, Row12 col4 = 8. First non-zero: 4. Output 4.\n\n- Column5: Row3 col5 = 0, Row6 col5 = 0, Row9 col5 = 2, Row12 col5 = 0. First non-zero: 2. Skip, next non-zero: none. Output 2.\n\n- Column6: Row3 col6 = 0, Row6 col6 = 0, Row9 col6 = 2, Row12 col6 = 0. First non-zero: 2. Skip, next non-zero: none. Output 2.\n\nSo row3: 5 5 5 4 2 2.\n\nThus the output grid is:\n\n5 0 5 4 2 5\n2 5 0 2 8 5\n5 5 5 4 2 2\n\nBut we need to double-check if any other rule might apply that could change any of these values. Let's examine each column again to ensure that we didn't misinterpret the rule. The rule is: \"take the first non-zero from top to bottom, but if that value is 2, skip it and take the next non-zero; if there is no next non-zero, keep 2.\" That is what we used. But let's check if there is any case where the top non-zero is 2 but there is a later non-zero that is also 2. But we skip the first 2 and take the next non-zero, which might also be 2. In that case, we would output 2 anyway. But we need to check if that scenario occurs in any example. Let's search: In Example 2 output row2, column3: top non-zero is 2, next non-zero is 8, so output 8. Good. In Example 2 output row2, column5: same. In Example 5 output row1, column3: top non-zero 2, next non-zero 8. Good. In Example 5 output row3, column6: top non-zero 2, next non-zero 8. Good. In Example 6 output row2, column1: top non-zero 2, next non-zero 8. Good. In Example 6 output row2, column3: top non-zero 2, next non-zero none. Output 2. Good. In Example 4 output row2, column1: top non-zero 2, next non-zero 8. Good. In Example 4 output row2, column5: top non-zero 5, output 5. Good.\n\nThus rule stands.\n\nBut we also need to consider whether there is any other rule that might produce a different output. Let's double-check the mapping for the test input. In all examples, the mapping used for output rows is consistent: output row1 uses row1,4,7,10; output row2 uses row2,5,8,11; output row3 uses row3,6,9,12. That seems consistent across all examples. So we can safely apply that.\n\nThus the output grid for test input should be as we computed.\n\nBut we need to double-check if the test input matches the pattern of having 4 layers of 3 rows each, each layer dominated by a single color. Let's check:\n\n- Layer1: rows 1-3: 5's appear in many cells. Yes.\n\n- Layer2: rows 4-6: 4's appear in many cells. Yes.\n\n- Layer3: rows 7-9: 2's appear in many cells. Yes.\n\n- Layer4: rows 10-12: 8's appear in many cells. Yes.\n\nSo the pattern holds.\n\nNow let's verify that for each column, the first non-zero is not 2 except for some columns. Let's list the values for each column for each layer:\n\n**Column1**:\n\n- Layer1 row1 col1 = 5\n- Layer2 row1 col1 = 0\n- Layer3 row1 col1 = 2\n- Layer4 row1 col1 = 0\n\nSo first non-zero is 5. So output 5. Good.\n\n**Column2**:\n\n- Layer1 row1 col2 = 0\n- Layer2 row1 col2 = 0\n- Layer3 row1 col2 = 0\n- Layer4 row1 col2 = 0\n\nSo output 0.\n\n**Column3**:\n\n- Layer1 row1 col3 = 5\n- Layer2 row1 col3 = 0\n- Layer3 row1 col3 = 2\n- Layer4 row1 col3 = 8\n\nFirst non-zero is 5. So output 5.\n\n**Column4**:\n\n- Layer1 row1 col4 = 0\n- Layer2 row1 col4 = 4\n- Layer3 row1 col4 = 0\n- Layer4 row1 col4 = 8\n\nFirst non-zero is 4. So output 4.\n\n**Column5**:\n\n- Layer1 row1 col5 = 0\n- Layer2 row1 col5 = 0\n- Layer3 row1 col5 = 2\n- Layer4 row1 col5 = 0\n\nFirst non-zero is 2. Skip. Next non-zero: none. So output 2.\n\n**Column6**:\n\n- Layer1 row1 col6 = 5\n- Layer2 row1 col6 = 4\n- Layer3 row1 col6 = 2\n- Layer4 row1 col6 = 0\n\nFirst non-zero is 5. So output 5.\n\nThus output row1 matches.\n\n**Column1 for row2**:\n\n- Layer1 row2 col1 = 0\n- Layer2 row2 col1 = 0\n- Layer3 row2 col1 = 2\n- Layer4 row2 col1 = 0\n\nFirst non-zero is 2. Skip. Next non-zero: none. So output 2.\n\n**Column2 for row2**:\n\n- Layer1 row2 col2 = 5\n- Layer2 row2 col2 = 0\n- Layer3 row2 col2 = 2\n- Layer4 row2 col2 = 8\n\nFirst non-zero is 5. Output 5.\n\n**Column3 for row2**:\n\n- Layer1 row2 col3 = 0\n- Layer2 row2 col3 = 0\n- Layer3 row2 col3 = 0\n- Layer4 row2 col3 = 0\n\nOutput 0.\n\n**Column4 for row2**:\n\n- Layer1 row2 col4 = 0\n- Layer2 row2 col4 = 0\n- Layer3 row2 col4 = 2\n- Layer4 row2 col4 = 0\n\nFirst non-zero is 2. Skip. Next non-zero: none. Output 2.\n\n**Column5 for row2**:\n\n- Layer1 row2 col5 = 0\n- Layer2 row2 col5 = 0\n- Layer3 row2 col5 = 2\n- Layer4 row2 col5 = 8\n\nFirst non-zero is 2. Skip. Next non-zero is 8. Output 8.\n\n**Column6 for row2**:\n\n- Layer1 row2 col6 = 5\n- Layer2 row2 col6 = 0\n- Layer3 row2 col6 = 2\n- Layer4 row2 col6 = 8\n\nFirst non-zero is 5. Output 5.\n\nThus row2 matches.\n\n**Column1 for row3**:\n\n- Layer1 row3 col1 = 5\n- Layer2 row3 col1 = 4\n- Layer3 row3 col1 = 2\n- Layer4 row3 col1 = 0\n\nFirst non-zero is 5. Output 5.\n\n**Column2 for row3**:\n\n- Layer1 row3 col2 = 5\n- Layer2 row3 col2 = 0\n- Layer3 row3 col2 = 2\n- Layer4 row3 col2 = 0\n\nFirst non-zero is 5. Output 5.\n\n**Column3 for row3**:\n\n- Layer1 row3 col3 = 5\n- Layer2 row3 col3 = 0\n- Layer3 row3 col3 = 2\n- Layer4 row3 col3 = 0\n\nFirst non-zero is 5. Output 5.\n\n**Column4 for row3**:\n\n- Layer1 row3 col4 = 0\n- Layer2 row3 col4 = 4\n- Layer3 row3 col4 = 2\n- Layer4 row3 col4 = 8\n\nFirst non-zero is 4. Output 4.\n\n**Column5 for row3**:\n\n- Layer1 row3 col5 = 0\n- Layer2 row3 col5 = 0\n- Layer3 row3 col5 = 2\n- Layer4 row3 col5 = 0\n\nFirst non-zero is 2. Skip. Next non-zero: none. Output 2.\n\n**Column6 for row3**:\n\n- Layer1 row3 col6 = 0\n- Layer2 row3 col6 = 0\n- Layer3 row3 col6 = 2\n- Layer4 row3 col6 = 0\n\nFirst non-zero is 2. Skip. Next non-zero: none. Output 2.\n\nThus row3 matches.\n\nThus output grid is:\n\nRow1: 5 0 5 4 2 5\nRow2: 2 5 0 2 8 5\nRow3: 5 5 5 4 2 2\n\nNow let's double-check if there is any potential alternative rule that could produce a different output. For example, maybe the rule is to take the first non-zero from top to bottom, but if that is 2, then skip it and take the next non-zero from the same layer? But we already considered that. Or maybe the rule is to take the first non-zero from top to bottom, but if that is 2, then we replace it with the next non-zero from the same layer? But that wouldn't apply because 2 appears only in one layer. Or maybe we skip all 2's entirely? But we keep 2 in some columns where it's the only non-zero. So the rule seems correct.\n\nNow let's test this rule on the test input again but with an alternative mapping: maybe the mapping is output row1 uses rows 1,4,7,10; row2 uses 2,5,8,11; row3 uses 3,6,9,12. That we used. So output is as above.\n\nBut we should also check if there might be a rule that uses some kind of \"color priority\" rather than 2 as a special placeholder. For example, maybe the rule is: take the topmost non-zero that is not 2; if topmost is 2, take the next non-zero; if no other non-zero, keep 2. That is what we used. So we are good.\n\nNow let's produce the final answer: 3 rows of 6 numbers each:\n\n5 0 5 4 2 5\n2 5 0 2 8 5\n5 5 5 4 2 2\n\nWe should output exactly that grid.\n\nBut before finalizing, let's double-check the test input to ensure we didn't misread any values.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow1: 5 0 5 0 0 5\nRow2: 0 5 0 0 0 5\nRow3: 5 5 5 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 4 0 4\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow6: 4 0 0 4 0 0\nRow7: 2 0 2 0 2 2\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 2 2\nRow9: 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow10: 0 0 8 8 0 0\nRow11: 0 8 0 0 8 8\nRow12: 0 0 0 8 0 0\n\nDouble-check each row:\n\n- Row1: 5,0,5,0,0,5. Yes.\n\n- Row2: 0,5,0,0,0,5. Yes.\n\n- Row3: 5,5,5,0,0,0. Yes.\n\n- Row4: 0,0,0,4,0,4. Yes.\n\n- Row5: 0,0,0,0,0,0. Yes.\n\n- Row6: 4,0,0,4,0,0. Yes.\n\n- Row7: 2,0,2,0,2,2. Yes.\n\n- Row8: 2,2,0,2,2,2. Yes.\n\n- Row9: 2,2,2,2,2,2. Yes.\n\n- Row10: 0,0,8,8,0,0. Yes.\n\n- Row11: 0,8,0,0,8,8. Yes.\n\n- Row12: 0,0,0,8,0,0. Yes.\n\nThus mapping is correct.\n\nNow we can produce final output.\n\nBut let's double-check if the output might be expected to be in a specific format, maybe each row on a new line, numbers separated by spaces. The examples show output as lines of numbers separated by spaces. So we will output:\n\n5 0 5 4 2 5\n2 5 0 2 8 5\n5 5 5 4 2 2\n\nNow let's double-check if any other rule might produce a different output. Let's consider the possibility that the rule might be \"take the first non-zero from top to bottom, but if that value is 2, replace it with the next non-zero; if no next non-zero, keep 2.\" That is exactly what we used. So it's correct.\n\nBut let's test if there is any column where the first non-zero is 2 but there is also a 2 later. That would produce 2 anyway. But let's see if that occurs in any example. In Example 5 output row3, column6: values: 0,0,2,8. First non-zero 2, next non-zero 8. So we output 8. In Example 5 output row1, column3: 0,0,2,8. Same. In Example 4 output row2, column1: 0,0,2,8. Same. In Example 2 output row2, column3: 0,0,2,8. Same. So all those follow rule. In Example 5 output row2, column1: 0,0,2,0. First non-zero 2, next non-zero none. Output 2. Good. In Example 6 output row2, column1: 0,0,2,8. Output 8. Good. In Example 6 output row2, column3: 0,0,2,0. Output 2. Good.\n\nThus rule is consistent.\n\nNow, we should also verify that we didn't misinterpret the mapping for output row2 in Example 6. Let's check Example 6 output row2 again: 8 5 2 5 5 5. We computed earlier that input rows 2,5,8,11: row2: 0 5 0 5 5 5; row5: 0 0 0 4 4 0; row8: 2 2 2 0 2 0; row11: 8 0 0 0 8 0. For each column:\n\n- Column1: 0,0,2,8 => first non-zero 2, skip, next non-zero 8 => output 8. Good.\n\n- Column2: 5,0,2,0 => first non-zero 5 => output 5. Good.\n\n- Column3: 0,0,2,0 => first non-zero 2 => skip, next non-zero none => output 2. Good.\n\n- Column4: 5,4,0,0 => first non-zero 5 => output 5. Good.\n\n- Column5: 5,4,2,8 => first non-zero 5 => output 5. Good.\n\n- Column6: 5,0,0,0 => first non-zero 5 => output 5. Good.\n\nThus rule matches.\n\nNow let's test Example 5 output row1 again to ensure we didn't misinterpret mapping: Input rows 1,4,7,10: row1: 5 0 0 0 0 0; row4: 4 4 0 4 4 4; row7: 2 0 2 2 0 2; row10: 8 8 8 8 0 8. For each column:\n\n- Column1: 5,4,2,8 => first non-zero 5 => output 5.\n\n- Column2: 0,4,0,8 => first non-zero 4 => output 4.\n\n- Column3: 0,0,2,8 => first non-zero 2 => skip, next non-zero 8 => output 8.\n\n- Column4: 0,4,2,8 => first non-zero 4 => output 4.\n\n- Column5: 0,4,0,0 => first non-zero 4 => output 4.\n\n- Column6: 0,4,2,8 => first non-zero 4 => output 4.\n\nThus output row1: 5 4 8 4 4 4. Good.\n\nNow Example 5 output row2: Input rows 2,5,8,11: row2: 0 5 0 0 0 5; row5: 0 0 0 0 0 0; row8: 2 2 0 2 2 0; row11: 0 0 0 8 8 0. For each column:\n\n- Column1: 0,0,2,0 => first non-zero 2 => skip, next non-zero none => output 2.\n\n- Column2: 5,0,2,0 => first non-zero 5 => output 5.\n\n- Column3: 0,0,0,0 => output 0.\n\n- Column4: 0,0,2,8 => first non-zero 2 => skip, next non-zero 8 => output 8.\n\n- Column5: 0,0,2,8 => same => output 8.\n\n- Column6: 5,0,0,0 => first non-zero 5 => output 5.\n\nThus output row2: 2 5 0 8 8 5. Wait, we earlier had output row2: 2 5 0 4 4 5? Wait, we need to double-check Example 5 output row2. The problem statement says Example 5 Output:\n\n5 4 8 4 4 4\n2 5 0 4 4 5\n4 0 5 5 5 8\n\nWait, that output row2 is \"2 5 0 4 4 5\". But we computed using the rule that output row2 col4 and col5 should be 8. But the given output row2 has 4 for col4 and col5. So our rule fails for Example 5 output row2. Let's double-check the input for Example 5 row5 and row8 and row11. Wait, maybe we mis-copied row5 or row8 or row11. Let's re-examine Example 5 input carefully:\n\nExample 5 Input:\n\nRow1: 5 0 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 5 0 0 0 5\nRow3: 0 0 5 5 5 0\nRow4: 4 4 0 4 4 4\nRow5: 0 0 0 4 4 0\nRow6: 4 0 4 4 0 0\nRow7: 2 0 2 2 0 2\nRow8: 2 2 0 2 2 0\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 0 2\nRow10: 8 8 8 8 0 8\nRow11: 0 0 0 8 8 0\nRow12: 0 0 0 8 8 8\n\nWait, earlier we had row5 as \"0 0 0 0 0 0\" but actually row5 is \"0 0 0 4 4 0\". So we mis-copied row5. That explains the difference. Let's recompute Example 5 output row2 with correct row5.\n\nInput rows for output row2: rows 2,5,8,11.\n\n- Row2: 0 5 0 0 0 5\n- Row5: 0 0 0 4 4 0\n- Row8: 2 2 0 2 2 0\n- Row11: 0 0 0 8 8 0\n\nNow compute for each column:\n\nCol1: 0,0,2,0 => first non-zero 2 => skip, next non-zero none => output 2.\n\nCol2: 5,0,2,0 => first non-zero 5 => output 5.\n\nCol3: 0,0,0,0 => output 0.\n\nCol4: 0,4,2,8 => first non-zero 4 => output 4.\n\nCol5: 0,4,2,8 => first non-zero 4 => output 4.\n\nCol6: 5,0,0,0 => first non-zero 5 => output 5.\n\nThus output row2: 2 5 0 4 4 5. That matches the given output. So our rule holds for Example 5 row2.\n\nThus our rule is correct.\n\nNow we should double-check Example 5 output row3 to ensure we didn't mis-copied row6 or row9 or row12. Let's recompute Example 5 output row3: rows 3,6,9,12:\n\n- Row3: 0 0 5 5 5 0\n- Row6: 4 0 4 4 0 0\n- Row9: 0 0 0 0 0 2\n- Row12: 0 0 0 8 8 8\n\nNow compute each column:\n\nCol1: 0,4,0,0 => first non-zero 4 => output 4.\n\nCol2: 0,0,0,0 => output 0.\n\nCol3: 5,4,0,0 => first non-zero 5 => output 5.\n\nCol4: 5,4,0,8 => first non-zero 5 => output 5.\n\nCol5: 5,0,0,8 => first non-zero 5 => output 5.\n\nCol6: 0,0,2,8 => first non-zero 2 => skip, next non-zero 8 => output 8.\n\nThus output row3: 4 0 5 5 5 8. That matches the given output. Good.\n\nThus our rule is consistent across all examples.\n\nNow we can confidently apply the rule to the test input. But we must double-check that we used the correct mapping of rows for each output row. Let's double-check for each example: In Example 1, we used mapping: output row1 uses rows 1,4,7,10. Did that produce the correct output? Yes. In Example 2, we used mapping: output row1 uses rows 1,4,7,10. That produced correct output. In Example 3, same mapping. In Example 4, same mapping. In Example 5, same mapping. In Example 6, same mapping. So mapping is consistent.\n\nThus we can produce the output for the test input.\n\nBut let's also double-check if there's any potential alternative mapping that could produce a different output. For example, maybe the mapping is output row1 uses rows 1,4,7,10; output row2 uses rows 2,5,8,11; output row3 uses rows 3,6,9,12. That we used. So it's consistent.\n\nNow let's produce the final output.\n\nBut before finalizing, let's check if any of the columns in the test input might have topmost non-zero being 2 but there is a next non-zero that is also 2. In that case, our rule would skip the first 2 and output the second 2. But that would produce the same output as 2. So it's fine. But let's check each column for such a scenario:\n\n- Column1: topmost non-zero is 5. So no skip.\n\n- Column2: all zeros. So output 0.\n\n- Column3: topmost non-zero is 5. So no skip.\n\n- Column4: topmost non-zero is 4. So no skip.\n\n- Column5: topmost non-zero is 2 (layer",
    "2": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze the ARC puzzle. The training examples show input and output. We need to deduce transformation rule.\n\nWe have 4 training examples, each with input grid of some size (varies) and output grid of smaller size. The output grid contains color 5, maybe representing some pattern derived from input. The input uses colors 0, 2, 3. The output uses 0 and 5. So we need to transform shapes of color 3 and 2 maybe into some pattern of 5.\n\nLet's examine each example carefully.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput grid: 4 rows, 14 columns? Let's count: row1: \"0 0 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\" => 14 columns. Row2: \"3 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 14. Row3: \"3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0\" => 14. Row4: \"0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 2 2 0 2\" => 14. So input grid is 4x14.\n\nOutput grid: 4 rows? Let's count: row1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 7 columns. Row2: \"0 5 5 5 5 0 5\" => 7. Row3: \"0 5 0 0 0 0 5\" => 7. Row4: \"5 5 5 0 0 0 0\" => 7. So output grid is 4x7.\n\nObservation: Input width 14, output width 7: exactly half. Input height 4, output height 4: same. So output is half width of input, same height. So maybe we compress input horizontally by merging pairs of columns into one output column, perhaps by applying some rule.\n\nLet's analyze mapping: For each output column, we might combine two input columns. For example, output col1 corresponds to input columns 0-1? Let's test.\n\nInput columns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13.\n\nOutput columns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6.\n\nLet's attempt to map: maybe output col j = combine input col 2j and 2j+1.\n\nLet's test: For row1: input row1: 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 0 0 0 0.\n\nCombine pairs: (0,0) -> output col0 maybe 0? In output row1 col0 is 0. Good.\n\n(3,3) -> output col1 maybe 5? Output row1 col1 is 0. Wait output row1 col1 is 0. Hmm.\n\nBut output row1 col1 is 0, but we might expect something else.\n\nLet's examine output row1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So all zeros. So maybe mapping is something else: maybe output is only 5's where something occurs, else 0. So maybe we are marking positions of something in the input.\n\nLet's examine Example1: Input has colors 3 and 2. Output has 5's maybe marking positions of 3's? Let's see.\n\nInput row1: 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 0 0 0 0.\n\nOutput row1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no 5's in row1. But input row1 had 3's and 2's. So maybe we mark positions where 3's are adjacent to 2's? Or something like that.\n\nLet's examine Example1 output row2: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5.\n\nInput row2: 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nPositions: col0=3, col5=3, col7=2. Output row2: col1-4 are 5's, col6 is 5. So output 5's at positions 1-4 and 6. These correspond to input columns 1-4? Wait output col index 1 corresponds to input col? Let's test mapping: output col1 maybe corresponds to input col? If mapping is shift? Let's list input row2: indices: 0:3,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:3,6:0,7:2,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0.\n\nOutput row2: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5. So 5's at indices 1,2,3,4,6 (0-based). That matches input indices 1-4 (zeros), and 6 (zero). So output 5's at positions where input has 0? Not exactly; input 0's at many positions but only some selected.\n\nMaybe output 5's correspond to positions where there is a 3 adjacent to a 2? Let's check.\n\nInput row2: 3 at col0, 3 at col5, 2 at col7. Are there zeros between 3 and 2? Yes between col5 and col7 there's col6=0. But output 5 at col6 matches that. Also output 5 at col1-4: maybe between col0 and col5 there's zeros. But maybe the rule: fill the horizontal gaps between 3's and 2's with 5's? But we also see output 5 at col1-4: that's the gap between col0 (3) and col5 (3). Wait but 3 to 3? There are two 3's separated by zeros. But maybe we fill the gap between 3's? But output 5's at col1-4 indeed fill the entire gap between col0 and col5.\n\nBut output row2 also has 5 at col6 (between 3 at col5 and 2 at col7). So rule: For each row, fill with 5 all cells that lie strictly between two cells of certain colors? Let's test.\n\nIn row2, we have 3 at col0, then 3 at col5. So the cells between them (col1-4) are 5. Also between 3 at col5 and 2 at col7, cells between them (col6) are 5. So we fill all cells between any pair of 'target' cells (maybe 3 and 2). But what about other rows?\n\nLet's examine row3 of example1.\n\nInput row3: \"3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0\". Output row3: \"0 5 0 0 0 0 5\". Output 5's at col1 and col6. Let's map input indices: 0:3,1:0,2:0,3:3,4:3,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:2,10:2,11:2,12:2,13:0.\n\nSo between 3 at col0 and 3 at col3? Wait there are two 3's at col0 and col3. The cells between them are col1-2. But output 5 at col1 only, not col2. So maybe rule is fill between a 3 and a 3? But output only at col1, not col2. Hmm.\n\nBetween 3 at col3 and 3 at col4: adjacent, no gap.\n\nBetween 3 at col4 and 2 at col9: cells col5-8. Output 5 at col6 only. So not all cells.\n\nMaybe rule is fill the middle cell of a gap? Let's examine: For gap between col0 and col3 (distance 3). The middle is col1? Actually positions: 0 and 3: gap length 2 cells (col1, col2). Middle of gap maybe col1.5? But we choose col1. So maybe rule: pick one of the cells? But we need to check other gaps.\n\nBetween 3 at col4 and 2 at col9: distance 5 cells (col5,6,7,8). The middle cell maybe col6 or col7? Actually center of 5 cells is the third cell (index 2 from start). Starting at col5: 0,6:0,7:0,8:0. The third cell is col7? Wait let's count: cells: col5 (1st), col6 (2nd), col7 (3rd), col8 (4th). There are 4 cells, not odd. But maybe we pick the second? But output 5 at col6. So maybe rule: pick the second cell? Not sure.\n\nLet's analyze Example2 to see patterns.\n\nExample2 Input: 4 rows, 14 columns? Let's count: row1: \"3 3 3 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\" => 14 columns. Row2: \"0 3 3 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 2\" => 14. Row3: \"0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 2 2 0 2 2\" => 14. Row4: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 2 2\" => 14.\n\nOutput: 4 rows, 7 columns: row1: \"0 0 0 5 0 0 0\" row2: \"0 0 0 0 0 5 0\" row3: \"5 5 0 0 0 0 0\" row4: \"5 5 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nLet's analyze mapping: maybe output col j corresponds to input col 2j+? Let's try to find mapping by analyzing positions of 5 in output.\n\nOutput row1: 5 at col3. Input row1: 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 2.\n\nIndices: 0:3,1:3,2:3,3:0,4:0,5:3,6:0,7:2,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:2,12:2,13:2.\n\nOutput 5 at col3. Which input indices correspond? Possibly 6? Let's test mapping: output col3 maybe input col6? Because 6 is 0, but output 5 at col3. That might correspond to input col6=0. But we need to see if output 5 at col3 is due to some gap between 3 and 2 maybe.\n\nLet's examine input row1: There are 3 at col5, 2 at col7: gap of one cell (col6). That cell is 0. Output 5 at col3. So maybe output col3 corresponds to input col6. But mapping 3 -> 6? Not linear. Let's check mapping for other rows.\n\nOutput row2: 5 at col5. Input row2: 0 3 3 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 2. Indices: 0:0,1:3,2:3,3:3,4:3,5:0,6:3,7:2,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:2. Gap between 3 at col6 and 2 at col7: no gap. Gap between 3 at col5 (0) and 3 at col6? Actually 3 at col6. Gap between 3 at col1-4 and 3 at col6? There's 0 at col5 between them. That might produce output 5 at col5? Output row2 has 5 at col5. So maybe mapping: output col5 corresponds to input col5? Wait output col5 is 5, input col5 is 0. So maybe output col5 corresponds to input col5? But output col5 is 5, input col5 is 0. So maybe output 5 marks where there is a 0 between 3 and 3? But not exactly.\n\nLet's analyze row3 of example2.\n\nInput row3: \"0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 2 2 0 2 2\". Indices: 0:0,1:0,2:3,3:0,4:3,5:3,6:3,7:0,8:0,9:2,10:2,11:0,12:2,13:2.\n\nOutput row3: \"5 5 0 0 0 0 0\". 5's at col0,1. So output col0 and col1 correspond to input indices? Possibly 0 and 1. Input at indices 0:0,1:0. So output 5's at 0,1. So maybe output 5 marks the first two cells of the row? But why?\n\nLet's analyze row4 of example2.\n\nInput row4: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 2 2\". Indices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:3,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:2,10:0,11:2,12:2,13:2.\n\nOutput row4: \"5 5 0 0 0 0 0\". 5's at col0,1. So again first two columns of output correspond to first two input cells? But maybe mapping is output col0 corresponds to input col0? Let's test: output row4 col0=5, input col0=0. So output 5 at col0. So maybe output 5 marks the first two cells of each row if they are 0? But row3 also had 0 at col0,1. Row2 had 0 at col0? Actually row2 col0=0, but output row2 col0=0. So not consistent.\n\nLet's analyze Example3.\n\nExample3 Input: 4 rows, 14 columns. Row1: \"0 0 3 0 3 3 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\". Row2: \"3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 2\". Row3: \"3 3 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\". Row4: \"3 3 3 0 0 0 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\". Output: 4 rows, 7 columns. Row1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 5\". Row2: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Row3: \"0 0 0 0 0 5 0\". Row4: \"0 0 0 5 5 5 0\".\n\nLet's analyze mapping.\n\nOutput row1: 5 at col6. Input row1: indices: 0:0,1:0,2:3,3:0,4:3,5:3,6:0,7:2,8:2,9:2,10:2,11:0,12:0,13:0. So output 5 at col6 maybe corresponds to input col? Let's test mapping: maybe output col6 corresponds to input col? Let's guess mapping: output col0 -> input col? Maybe mapping is output col j corresponds to input col 2j+? Let's test: if output col6 corresponds to input col? 2*6=12. Input col12 is 0. But output 5 at col6. But maybe mapping is output col j corresponds to input col 2j+? Let's compute: 2*6+? = 12+? -> maybe 12? So input col12=0. But output 5 at col6. So maybe rule: output 5 marks the position of 0 between 2 and 2? Wait input row1 has 2's at col7-10. There is 0 at col6 before the 2's. So maybe output 5 at col6 marks the last 0 before a block of 2's? Let's check other rows.\n\nOutput row2: all zeros. Input row2: \"3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 2\". Indices: 0:3,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:3,5:3,6:0,7:0,8:2,9:2,10:2,11:2,12:0,13:2. There is 2 at col8-11 and at 13. There is 0 at col7 before 2's. But output row2 has no 5. So maybe not that.\n\nOutput row3: 5 at col5. Input row3: \"3 3 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\". Indices: 0:3,1:3,2:0,3:3,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:2,8:0,9:2,10:0,11:2,12:0,13:2. Output 5 at col5. Which input cell corresponds? Maybe input col5=0. But there are 0's at many positions.\n\nOutput row4: 5's at col3,4,5. Input row4: \"3 3 3 0 0 0 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\". Indices: 0:3,1:3,2:3,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:3,7:2,8:2,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0. Output 5's at col3-5 correspond to input 0's at indices 3,4,5. These are between 3 at col2 and 3 at col6? Wait there is 3 at col2 and 3 at col6. Gap between them includes indices 3,4,5. So output 5's fill that gap. That matches earlier idea: fill gap between two 3's with 5. In Example1 row3, we had 3 at col0 and 3 at col3, gap indices 1,2. Output had 5 at col1 only. But maybe output 5 at col1 only because maybe rule: fill the first cell of the gap? But here we fill all cells between 3's? Let's check Example1 row3 again: 3 at col0, 3 at col3. Gap indices 1,2. Output 5 at col1 only, not at col2. So maybe we didn't fill all cells between 3's. But Example4 might clarify.\n\nLet's analyze Example4.\n\nInput: 4 rows, 14 columns. Row1: \"0 3 3 0 3 0 3 2 0 2 0 0 0 2\". Row2: \"3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\". Row3: \"0 3 3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 0 2\". Row4: \"0 3 3 0 3 0 3 0 2 2 2 0 2 0\".\n\nOutput: 4 rows, 7 columns. Row1: \"0 0 0 5 0 5 0\". Row2: \"0 5 0 5 0 0 5\". Row3: \"5 0 0 5 0 0 0\". Row4: \"5 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nLet's analyze mapping.\n\nRow1 input: 0 3 3 0 3 0 3 2 0 2 0 0 0 2. Output row1: 0 0 0 5 0 5 0.\n\nIndices input: 0:0,1:3,2:3,3:0,4:3,5:0,6:3,7:2,8:0,9:2,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:2. Output 5 at col3 and col5. Output col3 maybe corresponds to input col? Let's test mapping: maybe output col3 corresponds to input col? If mapping is output col j = input col 2j+? Let's try j=3 => 2*3=6, maybe +? 0? Input col6=3. Output col3=5. So maybe output 5 at col3 corresponds to input col6=3? Not sure.\n\nOutput col5 maybe corresponds to input col? j=5 => 2*5=10. Input col10=0. Output col5=5. So output 5 at col5 maybe corresponds to input col10=0? So maybe mapping is output col j = input col 2j+? but maybe offset 1? Let's test j=5 => 2*5+? = 10+? = 10? So input col10=0. So output 5 at col5 corresponds to input col10=0. So maybe mapping is output col j corresponds to input col 2j+? where ?=0. But j=3 => 2*3=6 => input col6=3. Output 5 at col3. So mapping: output col3 corresponds to input col6=3. So output 5 at col3 corresponds to input col6=3. But output 5 at col5 corresponds to input col10=0. So mapping is not consistent.\n\nLet's examine other rows.\n\nRow2 input: \"3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\". Output row2: \"0 5 0 5 0 0 5\". So output 5 at col1,3,6.\n\nIndices input: 0:3,1:0,2:3,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:2,12:2,13:0.\n\nOutput col1=5 maybe corresponds to input col? j=1 => 2*1=2 => input col2=3. So output 5 at col1 corresponds to input col2=3. Output col3=5 maybe corresponds to input col6=0? Wait 2*3=6 => input col6=0. Output col6=5 maybe corresponds to input col12=2? 2*6=12 => input col12=2. So mapping: output col j corresponds to input col 2j? That seems plausible: output col0->input col0; col1->input col2; col2->input col4; col3->input col6; col4->input col8; col5->input col10; col6->input col12.\n\nLet's test: For row2, output col1=5 corresponds to input col2=3. Output col3=5 corresponds to input col6=0. Output col6=5 corresponds to input col12=2. So output 5 at col1,3,6 correspond to input col2=3, col6=0, col12=2. So output 5 at col1 corresponds to 3. Output 5 at col3 corresponds to 0. Output 5 at col6 corresponds to 2. So output 5 at col3 maybe not due to 0? But maybe we output 5 at positions where the input at 2j is not 0? Wait input col6=0, but output 5 at col3. So rule: output 5 at all positions where input at 2j is 3 or 2? But input col6=0, so not 3 or 2. So maybe rule: output 5 at all positions where input at 2j is 3 or 2? That would give 5 at col1 (3), col6 (2). But output also at col3 (0). So maybe rule: output 5 at positions where input at 2j is 3 or 2 or maybe 0 if there is some other condition.\n\nLet's analyze row3 of example4.\n\nRow3 input: \"0 3 3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 0 2\". Output row3: \"5 0 0 5 0 0 0\". So output 5 at col0 and col3.\n\nMapping: output col0->input col0=0; output col3->input col6=3. So output 5 at col0 corresponds to input col0=0. Output 5 at col3 corresponds to input col6=3.\n\nRow4 input: \"0 3 3 0 3 0 3 0 2 2 2 0 2 0\". Output row4: \"5 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Output 5 at col0. Input col0=0.\n\nSo mapping seems to be output col j corresponds to input col 2j. That is consistent across rows: output col0->input col0, col1->input col2, col2->input col4, col3->input col6, col4->input col8, col5->input col10, col6->input col12. Let's verify with Example1.\n\nExample1: Input width 14. Output width 7. So mapping output col j -> input col 2j. Let's test.\n\nExample1 row1: Input: 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 0 0 0 0. Input col0=0, col2=3, col4=3, col6=3, col8=2, col10=0, col12=0. Output row1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output col0=0 matches input col0=0. Output col1=0 matches input col2=3? But output col1=0 while input col2=3. So mapping not exactly.\n\nLet's test mapping: output col1 should correspond to input col2=3. But output col1=0. So mapping fails. So mapping may be something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe output col j corresponds to input col 2j+? but maybe offset by 1? Let's test j=1 -> input col3? Input col3=3. Output col1=0. So no.\n\nMaybe mapping is output col j corresponds to input col 2j+1? Let's test: j=0->input col1=0, output col0=0 matches. j=1->input col3=3, output col1=0 mismatch. So no.\n\nLet's analyze Example1 more carefully.\n\nExample1 input width 14. Output width 7. So maybe output width is half width. But mapping might not be simple 2:1 mapping. Let's examine positions of 5 in output relative to input.\n\nExample1 output:\n\nRow2: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5. So 5's at col1-4 and col6. Input row2: 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. So 5's at col1-4 (positions between 3 at col0 and 3 at col5). 5 at col6 (between 3 at col5 and 2 at col7). So output 5's mark the cells between 3's and 3-2. But output col6 is at position 6, which is between col5 and col7. So output 5 at col6 corresponds to input col6. So mapping: output col6 -> input col6. So output col6 corresponds to input col6. So mapping may be output col j = input col j? Wait j=6 -> input col6. That is same index. But output width 7, input width 14. So j=6 -> input col6. But input width 14, j=6 is within input width. But we lost half of columns? Wait output width 7, input width 14. So output col6 maps to input col? maybe 6? That would be half of input width? But mapping might be output col j corresponds to input col j? But then we would have 7 columns mapping to 7 columns of input, but we have 14 columns. So maybe we are selecting every other column? Wait j=6 -> input col? j=6 -> maybe input col6? That would mean we are using only the first 7 columns of input? But input has 14 columns. But output col6 uses input col6, not col12. So maybe we are selecting the first half of columns? But output col0 uses input col0? Let's check output row2 col0=0, input col0=3? Wait output row2 col0=0, input col0=3. So output col0 is not input col0. So mapping not that.\n\nMaybe mapping is output col j corresponds to input col 2j+? but j=6 -> 2*6+? = 12+? = 6? That would require ?=-6, impossible. So mapping not linear.\n\nMaybe output width 7 is derived from counting something else: maybe we are extracting columns that contain at least one 3 or 2? Let's examine input columns that contain 3 or 2.\n\nExample1 input columns: Let's list each column's values across rows:\n\ncol0: row1=0,row2=3,row3=3,row4=0 => contains 3. col1: 0,0,0,0 => no 3 or 2. col2: 3,0,0,0 => contains 3. col3: 3,0,3,0 => contains 3. col4: 3,0,3,0 => contains 3. col5: 3,3,0,3 => contains 3. col6: 3,0,0,3 => contains 3. col7: 2,2,2,0 => contains 2. col8: 2,0,0,0 => contains 2. col9: 2,0,0,0 => contains 2. col10: 0,0,2,2 => contains 2. col11: 0,0,2,2 => contains 2. col12: 0,0,0,0 => no 3 or 2. col13: 0,0,0,2 => contains 2.\n\nSo many columns contain 3 or 2. But output width 7: maybe we are selecting columns that contain 3 or 2? There are 13 columns with 3 or 2. Not 7.\n\nMaybe we are selecting columns that contain 3 but not 2? Let's see: columns containing 3 but not 2: col0,2,3,4,5,6. That's 6 columns. Not 7.\n\nMaybe we are selecting columns that contain 2 but not 3: col7,8,9,10,11,13. That's 6 columns. Not 7.\n\nMaybe we are selecting columns that contain both 3 and 2? Let's see: any column that has both 3 and 2? col? Let's check: col0 has 3 but not 2. col2 has 3. col3 has 3. col4 has 3. col5 has 3. col6 has 3. col7 has 2 but not 3. col8 has 2. col9 has 2. col10 has 2. col11 has 2. col12 none. col13 has 2. So none contain both. So no.\n\nMaybe we are selecting columns that contain at least one 3 and at least one 0? But many.\n\nLet's analyze Example2: Input width 14, output width 7. So mapping may be similar. Let's examine Example2 mapping.\n\nExample2 input columns: We'll list columns of 3,2.\n\nRow1: 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\nRow2: 0 3 3 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 2\nRow3: 0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 2 2 0 2 2\nRow4: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 2 2\n\nLet's compute columns with 3 or 2.\n\ncol0: row1=3,row2=0,row3=0,row4=0 => 3 present\ncol1: 3,3,0,0 => 3\ncol2: 3,3,3,0 => 3\ncol3: 0,3,0,3 => 3\ncol4: 0,3,3,0 => 3\ncol5: 3,0,3,0 => 3\ncol6: 0,3,3,0 => 3\ncol7: 2,2,0,0 => 2\ncol8: 0,0,0,0 => none\ncol9: 0,0,2,2 => 2\ncol10: 0,0,2,0 => 2\ncol11: 2,0,0,2 => 2\ncol12: 2,0,2,2 => 2\ncol13: 2,2,2,2 => 2\n\nSo columns with 3 or 2: all except col8. So output width 7 cannot be selection of columns.\n\nMaybe output width 7 corresponds to selecting columns that are \"between\" two 3's? Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe output width 7 corresponds to the number of columns that contain a pattern of 3's in a vertical line of length at least 2? Let's check.\n\nColumns with at least two 3's: col0 has 3 at row1 only. col1 has 3 at rows1,2. col2 has 3 at rows1,2,3. col3 has 3 at rows2,4. col4 has 3 at rows2,3. col5 has 3 at rows1,3. col6 has 3 at rows2,3. col7 has 2. col9 has 2. col10 has 2. col11 has 2. col12 has 2. col13 has 2. So many.\n\nMaybe output width 7 corresponds to columns that have a vertical pattern of 3's that form a shape that we need to fill with 5's? But output 5's are placed in output grid, not input.\n\nWait maybe the transformation is: compress the input horizontally by merging pairs of columns that are symmetric? Let's examine Example1: Output width 7, input width 14. Maybe each output column corresponds to a pair of input columns that are symmetric around the center? But we need to test.\n\nMaybe the rule: For each pair of adjacent columns (col 2i and col 2i+1), produce an output column that is the majority color among the two columns? But output has only 0 and 5. So maybe 5 indicates that the two columns differ? Or that there is a 3 in one of them? Let's test.\n\nExample1: Pair col0-1: input col0: 0,3,3,0. col1: 0,0,0,0. So there is a 3 in col0 but not col1. Maybe output col0=0? But output col0=0. So maybe 5 indicates something else.\n\nPair col2-3: col2: 3,0,0,0; col3: 3,0,3,0. Contains 3's. Output col1=5? Wait output col1=5. So maybe output 5 indicates that the pair contains 3? But pair col2-3 contains 3's. So output col1=5. Pair col4-5: col4:3,0,3,0; col5:3,3,0,3. Contains 3's. Output col2=5. Pair col6-7: col6:3,0,0,3; col7:2,2,2,0. Contains 3 or 2. Output col3=5? Wait output col3=5? Actually output row2 col3=5. But output row2 col3 is 5. So output col3=5. Pair col8-9: col8:2,0,0,0; col9:2,0,0,0. Contains 2's. Output col4=5? Output row2 col4=5. Yes. Pair col10-11: col10:0,0,2,2; col11:0,0,2,2. Contains 2's. Output col5=0? Wait output row2 col5=0. But maybe we need to check row2. Actually output row2: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5. So col5=0. That pair contains 2's. So why 0? Let's check pair col12-13: col12:0,0,0,0; col13:0,0,0,2. Contains 2. Output col6=5. So output col6=5.\n\nSo mapping: For each pair of columns (2i,2i+1), we produce output col i. Output col i is 5 if the pair contains at least one 3 or 2? But pair col10-11 contains 2's but output col5=0. So maybe 5 indicates something else: maybe the pair contains a 3? But pair col10-11 has no 3's, only 2's. So output 0. Pair col12-13 contains 2 at col13, no 3's. But output 5. So maybe rule: 5 indicates presence of 3 OR 2 but also something about adjacency? Let's analyze pairs:\n\n- Pair 0-1: contains 3 at col0 row2 and col0 row3. But output col0=0. So not 5. So maybe rule: 5 indicates presence of 3 and 2 in the same pair? Let's check: Pair 0-1: 3 present, 2 not present. So no 5. Pair 2-3: 3 present, 2 not present. Output 5. So that contradicts.\n\nMaybe rule: 5 indicates presence of 3 in at least one of the two columns and that the other column is all zeros? Pair 0-1: col1 is all zeros, col0 has 3's. But output 0. So not.\n\nMaybe rule: 5 indicates presence of 3 in the left column of the pair? Pair 0-1: left col0 has 3 -> would be 5, but output 0. So no.\n\nMaybe rule: 5 indicates presence of 3 in the right column? Pair 0-1: right col1 has no 3 -> 0. Pair 2-3: right col3 has 3 -> 5. Pair 4-5: right col5 has 3 -> 5. Pair 6-7: right col7 has 2, but left col6 has 3. But right col7 has no 3. But output 5. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: 5 indicates presence of 3 in either column AND presence of 2 in either column? Pair 2-3: 3 present, 2 not present -> 5. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: 5 indicates presence of 3 in the left column OR 2 in the right column? Pair 0-1: left col0 has 3 -> would be 5 but output 0. So fails.\n\nLet's examine Example1 more thoroughly.\n\nExample1 input rows:\n\nRow1: 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 2 2 0 2\n\nLet's compute each column's content across rows:\n\ncol0: 0,3,3,0\ncol1: 0,0,0,0\ncol2: 3,0,0,0\ncol3: 3,0,3,0\ncol4: 3,0,3,0\ncol5: 3,3,0,3\ncol6: 3,0,0,3\ncol7: 2,2,2,0\ncol8: 2,0,0,0\ncol9: 2,0,0,0\ncol10: 0,0,2,2\ncol11: 0,0,2,2\ncol12: 0,0,0,0\ncol13: 0,0,0,2\n\nNow output row1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nrow2: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5\nrow3: 0 5 0 0 0 0 5\nrow4: 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's examine each output column j and the corresponding input columns maybe j*? Let's see.\n\nOutput col0: values across rows: [0,0,0,5]. Input col0: [0,3,3,0]. Input col1: [0,0,0,0]. Input col2: [3,0,0,0]. Input col3: [3,0,3,0]. Input col4: [3,0,3,0]. Input col5: [3,3,0,3]. Input col6: [3,0,0,3]. Input col7: [2,2,2,0]. Input col8: [2,0,0,0]. Input col9: [2,0,0,0]. Input col10: [0,0,2,2]. Input col11: [0,0,2,2]. Input col12: [0,0,0,0]. Input col13: [0,0,0,2].\n\nBut output col0 only has 5 in row4. So maybe output col0 corresponds to input col? Which column had a 5 in row4? Input col? Row4 col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=0, col4=0, col5=3, col6=3, col7=0, col8=0, col9=0, col10=2, col11=2, col12=0, col13=2. Only columns with 5 in output row4 col0: row4 col0 output=5. Which input column has a 5? Actually output is 5; input had 0. So maybe output 5 indicates something like presence of 3 in the same row but in some other column? Let's analyze.\n\nRow4 input: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 2 2 0 2. Output row4: 5 5 5 0 0 0 0. So output 5 at col0,1,2. These correspond to input columns 0,1,2? Input row4 col0=0, col1=0, col2=0. So output 5 at columns 0,1,2 correspond to input columns 0,1,2. But input row4 col0-2 are all zeros. So maybe output 5 at columns where input row4 has zeros but maybe there's a 3 somewhere else in that column? Let's check input columns 0,1,2 across all rows: col0 has 3 in rows2,3. col1 has none. col2 has 3 in row1. So maybe rule: for each row, output 5 at columns where that column in input has a 3 in some other row? That seems plausible: For row4, columns 0,1,2 have 3's in other rows: col0 has 3 in rows2,3; col1 has no 3; col2 has 3 in row1. So output 5 at col1 though there is no 3 in any row in column 1. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at columns where that column in input has 3 or 2 in some other row? Let's check: For row4, columns 0-2: col0 has 3; col1 has none; col2 has 3. So output 5 at col1 though no 3. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at columns where that column in input has 3 or 2 in the same column but not in that row? For row4, col1 has no 3/2 in other rows. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at columns where that column in input has a 3 or 2 in the same column but not in that row? For row4, col1 no 3/2 anywhere, so output 0 would be expected but we have 5.\n\nSo maybe rule: output 5 at columns where that column in input has at least one 3 in the entire grid? Let's test: columns with at least one 3: col0,2,3,4,5,6. But output row4 has 5 at columns 0,1,2. So column1 has no 3, but output 5. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at columns where that column in input has at least one 3 or 2 in the entire grid? Column1 has no 3 or 2. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at columns where that column in input has at least one 3 or 2 in the entire grid or maybe at least one 3 or 2 in the same row? For row4, column1 has no 3/2 in that row, but maybe we consider something else.\n\nLet's analyze output row3: 0 5 0 0 0 0 5. Output 5 at col1 and col6. Input row3: 3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0. So row3 has 3 at col0,3,4; 2 at col9-12. Output 5 at col1 and col6. col1 is between col0 and col3? Actually col1 is between col0 and col3? There are 2 cells between col0 and col3: col1,2. Output 5 at col1 only, not col2. col6 is between col4 and col9? Wait col4 has 3, col9 has 2. Gap between col4 and col9 includes col5-8. Output 5 at col6 only. So output 5 at col6 (one of the cells between 3 at col4 and 2 at col9). So maybe output 5 at the middle cell of the gap? Let's examine.\n\nFor row3, gap between col0 and col3: cells col1,2. The middle cell is col1.5? But we might choose the leftmost or rightmost? But output 5 at col1, not col2. So maybe rule: fill the first cell of each gap between a 3 and a 3? But there are two 3's at col0 and col3. So first cell of gap is col1. That matches. Gap between col4 and col9: cells col5,6,7,8. The first cell of gap is col5. But output 5 at col6. So not first.\n\nMaybe rule: fill the middle cell of each gap? Gap of length 4 cells: middle cells are col6 and col7? Actually if gap length 4, there are two middle cells: col6 and col7. Which one chosen? Output 5 at col6. So maybe choose the leftmost of the two middle cells. That would be col6. For gap length 2, the middle cells are col1 and col2? Wait gap length 2, there are no middle cells? Actually if there are 2 cells, there is no unique middle. But we might choose the first cell? That matches output 5 at col1.\n\nSo maybe rule: For each gap between two non-zero cells (like 3 or 2) in a row, fill the middle cell(s) with 5, but if the gap length is even, choose the leftmost of the two middle cells? That could produce output 5 at col1 and col6. Let's test with other rows.\n\nExample1 row2: Input row2: 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. Gaps:\n\n- Between 3 at col0 and 3 at col5: cells col1-4 (gap length 4). Middle cells: col2 and col3. Choose leftmost: col2. But output row2 has 5 at col1-4 (col1,2,3,4). So not just middle. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: fill entire gap between two non-zero cells? That would produce 5 at col1-4. That matches output row2. But then why row3 had only col1 and col6? Let's examine row3 again: Input row3: 3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0. Gaps:\n\n- Between 3 at col0 and 3 at col3: cells col1,2 (gap length 2). If we fill entire gap, we would have 5 at col1,2. But output only col1. So not entire gap.\n\n- Between 3 at col3 and 3 at col4: adjacent, no gap.\n\n- Between 3 at col4 and 2 at col9: cells col5-8 (gap length 4). If we fill entire gap, we would have 5 at col5,6,7,8. But output only col6. So not entire gap.\n\nThus rule not consistent.\n\nMaybe rule: fill only the cells that are at positions where the input cell is 0 but the cell to the left or right is 3 or 2? Let's test.\n\nFor row2: input row2: 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. The 0's that have a 3 on left or right: positions:\n\n- col1: left 3 at col0, right 0 at col2. So qualifies. Output 5 at col1.\n\n- col2: left 0 at col1, right 0 at col3. No 3/2 adjacent. But output 5 at col2. So fails.\n\n- col3: left 0 at col2, right 0 at col4. No. But output 5 at col3.\n\n- col4: left 0 at col3, right 3 at col5. qualifies. Output 5 at col4.\n\n- col6: left 3 at col5, right 2 at col7. qualifies. Output 5 at col6.\n\n- col7: left 0 at col6, right 0 at col8. Not qualifies. Output 0 at col7. Good.\n\n- col8: left 0 at col7, right 0 at col9. Not qualifies. Output 0 at col8.\n\n- col9: left 0 at col8, right 0 at col10. Not qualifies. Output 0.\n\n- col10: left 0 at col9, right 0 at col11. Not qualifies. Output 0.\n\n- col11: left 0 at col10, right 0 at col12. Not qualifies. Output 0.\n\n- col12: left 0 at col11, right 0 at col13. Not qualifies. Output 0.\n\n- col13: left 0 at col12, right none. Not qualifies. Output 0.\n\nSo rule: output 5 at 0 cells that are adjacent to a 3 or 2 horizontally. This matches row2: col1,2,3,4,6. Wait col2 and col3 have no adjacent 3/2? Actually col2: left col1=0, right col3=0. So not adjacent to 3/2. But output 5 at col2. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at 0 cells that are adjacent to a 3 or 2 on either side, or at the edges of a gap between 3 and 3 or 3 and 2? Hmm.\n\nLet's examine row3: Input row3: 3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0. 0 cells: col1,2,5,6,7,8,13. Adjacent to 3/2? col1: left 3 at col0, right 0 at col2 -> qualifies. col2: left 0 at col1, right 3 at col3 -> qualifies. So output 5 at col1 and col2? But output only col1. So fails.\n\ncol5: left 3 at col4, right 0 at col6 -> qualifies. col6: left 0 at col5, right 0 at col7 -> not. col7: left 0 at col6, right 0 at col8 -> not. col8: left 0 at col7, right 2 at col9 -> qualifies. col13: left 2 at col12, right none -> qualifies.\n\nOutput row3: 5 at col1 and col6. So col1 qualifies, col6 does not. So rule fails.\n\nLet's examine row4: Input row4: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 2 2 0 2. 0 cells: col0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,12. Adjacent to 3/2? col0: left none, right 0 at col1 -> no. col1: left 0, right 0 -> no. col2: left 0, right 0 -> no. col3: left 0, right 0 -> no. col4: left 0, right 3 at col5 -> qualifies. col7: left 3 at col6, right 0 at col8 -> qualifies. col8: left 0 at col7, right 0 at col9 -> no. col9: left 0 at col8, right 0 at col10 -> no. col10: left 0 at col9, right 2 at col11 -> qualifies. col12: left 0 at col11, right 2 at col13 -> qualifies.\n\nOutput row4: 5 at col0,1,2. So 5 at col0,1,2 which do not have adjacent 3/2. So rule fails.\n\nThus output 5 positions are not simply adjacent to 3/2.\n\nLet's examine pattern of 5 in output relative to input positions of 3 and 2. Perhaps output 5 marks the \"midpoint\" of a line segment connecting 3 and 2? But row2: 3 at col0 and 3 at col5: output 5 at col1-4, not just midpoint. So maybe output 5 marks all cells between 3 and 3 (and between 3 and 2). But row3: 3 at col0 and 3 at col3: output 5 at col1 only, not col2. So not all cells.\n\nMaybe output 5 marks the \"first\" cell of each gap between 3 and 3 or 3 and 2. But row2: first cell of gap between col0 and col5 is col1. But output 5 at col1-4. So not just first.\n\nMaybe output 5 marks the \"last\" cell of each gap? For row2: last cell of gap between col0 and col5 is col4. But output 5 at col1-4. So includes last but also earlier.\n\nMaybe output 5 marks all cells between 3 and 3 except the last? But row2: output 5 at col1-4, yes all except maybe col5? Wait col5 is 3. So output 5 at col1-4. That matches \"all cells between 3 and 3\" (col0 and col5). So maybe rule: fill entire gap between 3 and 3 with 5. That matches row2.\n\nNow row3: 3 at col0 and 3 at col3: gap cells col1,2. Output 5 at col1 only. So not all cells. So maybe we need to consider something else: maybe there is also a 3 at col4 adjacent to col3, so maybe the gap between col0 and col4? But col0 and col4: cells col1-3. Output 5 at col1 only. So not all cells.\n\nMaybe we consider only the leftmost 3 in the row? Let's examine row3: leftmost 3 at col0, next 3 at col3. Gap col1-2. Output 5 at col1 only. So maybe we fill only the first cell of the gap between the first and second 3? But row2: leftmost 3 at col0, second 3 at col5: gap col1-4. Output 5 at col1-4. So again not just first.\n\nMaybe rule: fill entire gap between the first and second 3 if there are no other 3's between them? But row3 has a 3 at col4 which is between col3 and col4? Actually col4 is adjacent to col3, so not between col0 and col3. So not relevant.\n\nBut maybe we fill entire gap between the first and second 3 only if there are no other 3's in between? That holds for row2: between col0 and col5, there are no 3's at col1-4. So we fill entire gap. For row3: between col0 and col3, there is no 3 at col1-2. So we should fill entire gap, but output only col1. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: fill entire gap between 3 and 3 only if there is no 3 at col1? But there is no 3 at col1. So fails.\n\nLet's analyze other rows: Example1 row1: Input row1: 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 0 0 0 0. 3's at col2-6. 2's at col7-9. Output row1: all zeros. So no 5's. So rule: maybe we only mark gaps that are not adjacent to 2? But row2 has 3-3 gap and 3-2 gap. Output 5 at both. So not.\n\nMaybe rule: we only mark gaps that are not at the edges? But row1 has 3-2 gap at col6-7? Actually 3 at col6, 2 at col7: adjacent, no gap. So no 5. But there is a 3-3 gap at col2-3? Actually 3 at col2,3 adjacent. So no gap. So no 5. So row1 has no gaps between 3's or 3-2? Actually there are no 3-3 gaps because 3's are contiguous. So no 5. That matches.\n\nRow2 has 3-3 gap between col0 and col5 because there is a 3 at col5 but col0-4 zeros. So there is a gap. Row2 also has 3-2 gap between col5 and col7. So we mark them. Row3 has 3-3 gap between col0 and col3. Gap cells col1,2. But output only col1. So maybe we fill only one of the two cells? Let's examine row3: there is also 3-3 gap between col3 and col4? Actually col3 and col4 are adjacent, so no gap. So only one gap between 3's. But we output only one 5. So maybe we fill only the leftmost cell of the gap? But row2 gap col1-4, leftmost cell col1, but output 5 at col1-4. So no.\n\nMaybe we fill the gap between 3's only if the gap length > 2? But row3 gap length 2, so we fill only one cell? But row2 gap length 4, we fill all cells. So maybe we fill all cells if gap length > 2, else fill one cell? But row3 gap length 2, we fill one cell (col1). Row2 gap length 4, we fill 4 cells. Row2 also has 3-2 gap length 1, we fill that cell (col6). So rule: For a gap between a 3 and a 3 or 3 and 2, if the gap length is 1, fill that cell. If gap length > 1, fill all cells. But row3 gap length 2, we would fill both cells, but we didn't. So maybe we treat gap between 3 and 3 differently? Let's examine row3: 3 at col0 and 3 at col3. Gap length 2. But maybe because there is a 3 at col4 adjacent to col3, the presence of another 3 after the gap influences the fill? But not.\n\nLet's examine Example2 to see pattern.\n\nExample2 Input and Output:\n\nInput row1: 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\n\nOutput row1: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nOutput 5 at col3 only. Input row1: 3's at col0-2,3? Actually 3 at col5. 2 at col7, 2 at col11-13. So 3-2 gap between col5 and col7: cells col6 (0). Output 5 at col3? Wait col3 is not col6. So maybe mapping: output col3 corresponds to input col6? That would be 0. So output 5 at col3 maybe indicates something else.\n\nLet's examine row1: maybe we are marking the \"gap\" between 3's at col0-2 and 3 at col5? There is a gap of zeros at col3-4. Gap length 2. Output 5 at col3 only. So maybe we fill leftmost cell of the gap between 3 and 3? That matches: leftmost of gap between col2 and col5 is col3. So output 5 at col3.\n\nAlso there is a 3 at col5 and 2 at col7: gap col6. Output 5 at col3, not col? So not.\n\nAlso there is 2 at col11-13 contiguous, no gap.\n\nSo output row1 has only one 5 at col3. That matches leftmost of the gap between 3's at col2 and col5. So maybe rule: for each gap between two 3's, mark the leftmost cell of the gap with 5. For each gap between 3 and 2, mark the cell between them? But row1 has 3-2 gap at col6, but output 5 at col3 not col6. So maybe we ignore 3-2 gaps? But row2 output has 5 at col5 (which is between 3 at col6 and 2 at col13? Actually 3 at col6 and 2 at col13: gap col7-12. Output 5 at col5? Wait col5 is not in that gap. So maybe we ignore 3-2 gaps entirely.\n\nLet's examine Example2 row2: Input row2: 0 3 3 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 2. Output row2: 0 0 0 0 0 5 0. Output 5 at col5. Input row2: 3's at col1-4,6; 2 at col7,13. Gaps: between col4 and col6: col5. Gap length 1. Between col6 and col7: adjacent? Actually col6=3, col7=2: adjacent, no gap. So maybe we mark the leftmost cell of the gap between 3's at col4 and col6: col5. Output 5 at col5. That matches rule: leftmost cell of gap between 3's.\n\nRow3 input: 0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 2 2 0 2 2. Output row3: 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. Output 5 at col0,1. Input row3: 3's at col2,4-6; 2's at col9-10,12-13. Gaps: between col2 and col4: col3. Gap length 1. Between col6 and col9: col7-8. Gap length 2. Between col10 and col12: col11. Gap length 1. So leftmost cells of gaps: col3, col7, col11. But output 5 at col0,1, not those. So rule fails.\n\nLet's examine Example2 row4: Input row4: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 2 2. Output row4: 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. Output 5 at col0,1. Input row4: 3 at col3; 2 at col9,11-13. Gaps: between col3 and col9: col4-8 length 5. Leftmost cell col4. But output 5 at col0,1. So rule fails.\n\nThus rule cannot be simply leftmost cell of gap between 3's.\n\nLet's analyze Example3.\n\nExample3 Input:\n\nRow1: 0 0 3 0 3 3 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow2: 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 2\nRow3: 3 3 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\nRow4: 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0\n\nOutput width 7, input width 14. So mapping maybe output col j corresponds to input col 2j? Let's test.\n\nRow1 output col6=5. Input col12=0. But maybe mapping is output col6 corresponds to input col? Wait j=6 -> 2*6=12. Input col12=0. But output 5. So mapping not simple.\n\nLet's examine output 5 positions relative to input patterns.\n\nRow1 output 5 at col6. Input row1: 0 0 3 0 3 3 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. The 5 at output col6 corresponds maybe to input col? Let's examine potential mapping: output col6 might correspond to input col? If we map j=6 -> input col? Suppose we map j=6 -> input col 13? That would be 0. So output 5 at col6 maybe indicates something else.\n\nLet's examine row4 output: 5's at col3,4,5. Input row4: 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So 5's at output col3-5 correspond to input columns maybe 6-8? Let's check: input col6=3, col7=2, col8=2. So 3-2-2. But output 5 at col3-5. So maybe output 5 at positions corresponding to input 3-2-2? Not sure.\n\nLet's examine row3 output: 5 at col5. Input row3: 3 3 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So maybe output 5 at col5 corresponds to input col? 2*5=10? Input col10=0. Not 3 or 2. But maybe output 5 at col5 corresponds to input col? 2*5+? =? Let's try 2*5+?=? maybe 12? Input col12=0. Not.\n\nLet's examine row2 output: all zeros. Input row2: 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 2. Maybe no output 5 because there is no 3-2 gap? Actually there is 3 at col4-5, 2 at col8-11, and 2 at col13. Gaps: between col5 and col8: cells 6-7. Gap length 2. But output row2 has no 5. So maybe rule: only fill gaps between 3 and 3? But row3 had gap between 3 at col0 and 3 at col3. That had 5 at col1. So maybe rule: fill gaps between 3's but not 3-2. But row2 has no 3-3 gaps because 3's at col0? Wait row2 has 3 at col0. There is no other 3 after col0? Actually row2 has 3 at col0? Wait row2: \"3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 2\". Yes 3 at col0, then 3 at col4,5. So there is a 3 at col0 and 3 at col4: gap col1-3. Gap length 3. So we might fill something? But output row2 has no 5. So rule fails.\n\nLet's analyze Example4.\n\nExample4 Input:\n\nRow1: 0 3 3 0 3 0 3 2 0 2 0 0 0 2\nRow2: 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\nRow3: 0 3 3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 0 2\nRow4: 0 3 3 0 3 0 3 0 2 2 2 0 2 0\n\nOutput:\n\nRow1: 0 0 0 5 0 5 0\nRow2: 0 5 0 5 0 0 5\nRow3: 5 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow4: 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput width 7, input width 14.\n\nWe need to find rule that maps input to output across all examples.\n\nLet's list the positions of 5 in output for each example relative to input.\n\nWe can try to identify a transformation that uses the input's 3 and 2 to produce 5's in a compressed grid.\n\nMaybe the rule: compress the input by grouping columns into pairs (two columns per output column). For each pair, we compute something like: if the pair contains a 3 in either column, set output cell to 5, else if it contains a 2, set output cell to 5? But we saw mismatches.\n\nLet's test this rule on Example2: For each pair of columns (0-1,2-3,4-5,...). For each pair, if either column contains a 3 or 2, set output cell to 5. Let's test.\n\nExample2 row1: Input row1: 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 2.\n\nPairs:\n\n- col0-1: 3,3 -> contains 3 -> output 5? But output row1 col0=0. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: set output cell to 5 only if the pair contains a 3 but not a 2? Let's test:\n\n- col0-1: 3,3 -> contains 3, no 2 -> output 5? But output 0.\n\nMaybe rule: set output cell to 5 only if the pair contains a 3 and the other column is 0? Let's test:\n\n- col0-1: 3,3 -> both 3, no 0 -> output 0. That matches. col2-3: 3,0 -> contains 3 and other is 0 -> output 5? Output row1 col1=0. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: set output cell to 5 only if the pair contains a 3 in the first column and 0 in the second? Let's test:\n\n- col0-1: 3,3 -> first 3, second not 0 -> no 5. Output 0. Good.\n- col2-3: 3,0 -> first 3, second 0 -> 5? Output row1 col1=0. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: set output cell to 5 if the pair contains a 3 in the second column? Let's test:\n\n- col0-1: second column 3 -> 5? Output 0. So fails.\n\nSo rule not simple.\n\nLet's examine the pattern of 5's in output relative to input columns.\n\nMaybe the rule: For each pair of columns (2i, 2i+1), we look at the pattern of 3 and 2 in those two columns across all rows. Then we produce output cell 5 if the pattern matches a specific configuration (like one column has 3 and the other has 2, or something). But we need to test.\n\nLet's examine Example1: For each pair of columns (0-1,2-3,...). Let's compute for each pair the set of colors present across all rows.\n\nWe'll produce a table of pair index i (0-6) and the set of colors present in that pair across all rows.\n\nExample1 pairs:\n\n- Pair0: cols0-1: values across rows: col0: [0,3,3,0]; col1: [0,0,0,0]. Combined set: {0,3}. So contains 3 but no 2.\n\n- Pair1: cols2-3: col2: [3,0,0,0]; col3: [3,0,3,0]. Combined set: {0,3}. Contains 3.\n\n- Pair2: cols4-5: col4: [3,0,3,0]; col5: [3,3,0,3]. Combined set: {0,3}. Contains 3.\n\n- Pair3: cols6-7: col6: [3,0,0,3]; col7: [2,2,2,0]. Combined set: {0,2,3}. Contains 3 and 2.\n\n- Pair4: cols8-9: col8: [2,0,0,0]; col9: [2,0,0,0]. Combined set: {0,2}. Contains 2.\n\n- Pair5: cols10-11: col10: [0,0,2,2]; col11: [0,0,2,2]. Combined set: {0,2}. Contains 2.\n\n- Pair6: cols12-13: col12: [0,0,0,0]; col13: [0,0,0,2]. Combined set: {0,2}. Contains 2.\n\nNow output row2 (since row2 is the only row with 5's except row3 and row4). But maybe the rule is per row, not per pair aggregated across all rows. But maybe the rule uses per row pairs.\n\nLet's compute per row pairs for row2.\n\nRow2 input: 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nPairs:\n\n- Pair0: cols0-1: 3,0 -> set {0,3}. Contains 3.\n- Pair1: cols2-3: 0,0 -> set {0}. Contains no 3/2.\n- Pair2: cols4-5: 0,3 -> set {0,3}. Contains 3.\n- Pair3: cols6-7: 0,2 -> set {0,2}. Contains 2.\n- Pair4: cols8-9: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair5: cols10-11: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair6: cols12-13: 0,0 -> {0}\n\nOutput row2: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5.\n\nSo output 5 at pairs 1,2,3,6? Actually output col1=5, col2=5, col3=5, col4=5, col6=5. Wait output col0=0, col1=5, col2=5, col3=5, col4=5, col5=0, col6=5. So output 5 at pairs 1,2,3,4,6. But pairs 1 and 2 contain 3, pair3 contains 2, pair4 contains 0, pair6 contains 0. So rule not simply based on presence of 3 or 2.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at pair i if the pair contains at least one 3 and at least one 2? Let's check:\n\n- Pair1: contains 3 only -> not 5? But output 5 at pair1. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 if the pair contains 3 or 2 AND the other column of the pair is 0? Let's test:\n\n- Pair1: 0,0 -> other column 0 -> output 5. Yes.\n- Pair2: 0,3 -> other column 0 -> output 5. Yes.\n- Pair3: 0,2 -> other column 0 -> output 5. Yes.\n- Pair4: 0,0 -> other column 0 -> output 5. Yes.\n- Pair6: 0,0 -> other column 0 -> output 5. Yes.\n- Pair0: 3,0 -> other column 0 -> output 0. But output 0. So fails.\n\nWait pair0: 3,0 -> other column 0? Actually pair0: columns 0-1: values 3 and 0. So one column is 3, the other is 0. According to rule \"contains 3 or 2 AND other column is 0\", this pair qualifies. But output 0. So fails.\n\nBut maybe rule: output 5 only if the pair contains 3 and the other column is 0 AND the pair is not the first pair? But why would that be? Not.\n\nLet's examine Example1 row3 output: 0 5 0 0 0 0 5. Input row3: 3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0.\n\nPairs row3:\n\n- Pair0: 3,0 -> set {0,3} -> contains 3.\n- Pair1: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair2: 0,3 -> {0,3}\n- Pair3: 3,0 -> {0,3}\n- Pair4: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair5: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair6: 0,0 -> {0}\n\nOutput row3: 0 5 0 0 0 0 5. So output 5 at pair1 and pair6. Pair1 has 0,0 -> both 0. Pair6 has 0,0 -> both 0. So rule: output 5 at pairs where both columns are 0? That would produce 5 at pair1 and pair6. That matches row3 output. But row2 had 5 at pair1,2,3,4,6. Let's check which pairs had both columns 0 in row2: pair1: 0,0; pair4: 0,0; pair5: 0,0; pair6: 0,0. So row2 had 5 at pair1,4,5,6. But output row2 had 5 at pair1,2,3,4,6. So pair2 and pair3 had at least one non-zero. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at pair i if the pair contains a 0 that is adjacent to a 3 or 2? But we saw earlier that fails.\n\nLet's examine Example2 output pattern relative to pairs.\n\nExample2 input width 14, output width 7. So mapping maybe output col j corresponds to input col 2j? Let's test for Example2.\n\nRow1 input: 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 2. Input col0=3, col2=3, col4=0, col6=0, col8=0, col10=0, col12=2. Output row1: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So output col3=5. That corresponds to input col6? Because 2*3=6. Input col6=0. So output 5 at col3 corresponds to input col6=0. So maybe rule: output 5 at columns where the input at 2j is 0 and the input at 2j+1 is 3? Let's check: For j=3, input col6=0, col7=2. So not 3. So fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mapping is output col j corresponds to input col 2j+1? For j=3, 2j+1=7. Input col7=2. So output 5 at col3 corresponds to input col7=2. That might be a rule: output 5 if input col 2j+1 is 2? Let's test for other j.\n\nRow1 output 5 at col3 only. Input col7=2. So yes. Check other j: j=0: input col1=3. Output 0. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 if input col 2j+1 is 2 and input col 2j is 0? For j=3: input col6=0, col7=2 -> 5. j=0: col0=3, col1=3 -> not. j=1: col2=3, col3=0 -> not. j=2: col4=0, col5=3 -> not. j=4: col8=0, col9=0 -> not. j=5: col10=0, col11=2 -> input col10=0, col11=2 -> would output 5? But output col5=0. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 if input col 2j+1 is 2 and input col 2j+2 is 0? Let's test: For j=3: input col7=2, col8=0 -> 5. For j=5: input col11=2, col12=2 -> not 0. So no 5. That matches output. But j=0: col1=3, col2=3 -> not 2. So no 5. j=1: col3=0, col4=0 -> no. j=2: col5=3, col6=0 -> not 2. j=4: col9=0, col10=0 -> not 2. So rule holds for row1. Let's test row2.\n\nRow2 input: 0 3 3 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 2. Output row2: 0 0 0 0 0 5 0. So output 5 at col5. For j=5: input col11=0, col12=0? Wait mapping: j=5 -> input col11? Actually 2j+1=11? Wait j=5: 2j+1=11. Input col11=0. Input col12=0. So not 2. So rule fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mapping: output col j corresponds to input col 2j+1? Let's test j=5: input col11=0. So not 2. So fails.\n\nLet's try mapping j -> input col 2j+? But maybe we need to consider vertical patterns too.\n\nLet's analyze Example2 row2: Input row2: 0 3 3 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 2. The 5 at output col5 might correspond to input col? Let's compute 2*5=10. Input col10=0. So not 2. 2*5+1=11: input col11=0. So not 2. 2*5+2=12: input col12=0. So not 2. So output 5 at col5 does not correspond to a 2 in the input. So rule not that.\n\nLet's analyze Example2 row3: Output row3: 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. 5 at col0,1. Input row3: 0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 2 2 0 2 2. Let's see mapping j=0: input col0=0. j=1: input col2=3. So output 5 at col0 and col1. So maybe rule: output 5 at columns where input col 2j is 0 or 3? But row2 col0 input col0=0, output 0. So fails.\n\nLet's analyze Example2 row4: Output row4: 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. Input row4: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 2 2. For j=0: input col0=0 -> 5. j=1: input col2=0 -> 5. So maybe rule: output 5 if input col 2j is 0. That would produce 5 at j=0,1,2,3,4,5,6? But output row4 has 5 at j=0,1 only. So fails.\n\nSo mapping is not simple.\n\nLet's analyze Example3 output relative to input pairs.\n\nExample3 input width 14, output width 7. Let's compute per row pairs.\n\nRow1 input: 0 0 3 0 3 3 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nPairs:\n\n- Pair0: cols0-1: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair1: cols2-3: 3,0 -> {0,3}\n- Pair2: cols4-5: 3,3 -> {3}\n- Pair3: cols6-7: 0,2 -> {0,2}\n- Pair4: cols8-9: 2,2 -> {2}\n- Pair5: cols10-11: 2,0 -> {0,2}\n- Pair6: cols12-13: 0,0 -> {0}\n\nOutput row1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5. Output 5 at col6 only. So output 5 at pair6. Pair6 had {0}. So output 5 at pair6 where pair has only zeros. So maybe rule: output 5 at pairs that contain only zeros? But row3 output row1 had 5 at pair6 only. Row1 pair6 had only zeros. But row1 also had pair0 with zeros only, but output 0. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at the pair that is the last pair? But row1 pair6 is last. Row2 output row1 has 5 at col6. Row3 output row2 has 5 at col5? Wait row2 output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. No 5. So rule not.\n\nLet's examine Example3 row4: Input row4: 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nPairs:\n\n- Pair0: cols0-1: 3,3 -> {3}\n- Pair1: cols2-3: 3,0 -> {0,3}\n- Pair2: cols4-5: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair3: cols6-7: 3,2 -> {2,3}\n- Pair4: cols8-9: 2,0 -> {0,2}\n- Pair5: cols10-11: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair6: cols12-13: 0,0 -> {0}\n\nOutput row4: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0. Output 5 at col3,4,5. That is pairs 3,4,5. Pair3 had {2,3}. Pair4 had {0,2}. Pair5 had {0}. So output 5 at pairs 3,4,5. So rule: output 5 at pairs that contain at least one 2? Pair3 contains 2, yes. Pair4 contains 2, yes. Pair5 contains no 2. So not.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at pairs that contain 3 but not 0? Pair3 contains 3, yes. Pair4 contains 3? No. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at pairs that contain 3 or 2 but not both? Pair3 contains both 3 and 2. But output 5. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at pairs that contain at least one 3? Pair3 contains 3. Pair4 does not contain 3. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at pairs that are not the first? But output 5 at pairs 3,4,5. Pair0,1,2 not. So maybe rule: output 5 at pairs that are after the first pair of zeros? Not.\n\nLet's analyze Example4 output relative to pairs.\n\nExample4 input width 14, output width 7. Let's compute per row pairs.\n\nRow1 input: 0 3 3 0 3 0 3 2 0 2 0 0 0 2.\n\nPairs:\n\n- Pair0: cols0-1: 0,3 -> {0,3}\n- Pair1: cols2-3: 3,0 -> {0,3}\n- Pair2: cols4-5: 3,0 -> {0,3}\n- Pair3: cols6-7: 3,2 -> {2,3}\n- Pair4: cols8-9: 0,2 -> {0,2}\n- Pair5: cols10-11: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair6: cols12-13: 0,2 -> {0,2}\n\nOutput row1: 0 0 0 5 0 5 0. Output 5 at col3 and col5. That is pairs 3 and 5. Pair3 has {2,3}. Pair5 has {0}. So rule: output 5 at pairs that contain 2? Pair3 contains 2. Pair5 doesn't. So fails.\n\nRow2 input: 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0.\n\nPairs:\n\n- Pair0: 3,0 -> {0,3}\n- Pair1: 3,0 -> {0,3}\n- Pair2: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair3: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair4: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair5: 0,2 -> {0,2}\n- Pair6: 2,0 -> {0,2}\n\nOutput row2: 0 5 0 5 0 0 5. Output 5 at col1,3,6. That is pairs 1,3,6. Pair1 has {0,3}. Pair3 has {0}. Pair6 has {0,2}. So rule: output 5 at pairs with 3? Pair1 has 3. Pair3 has no 3. Pair6 has 2. So maybe rule: output 5 at pairs that contain 3 or 2? But pair3 has no 3 or 2, but output 5. So fails.\n\nRow3 input: 0 3 3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 0 2.\n\nPairs:\n\n- Pair0: 0,3 -> {0,3}\n- Pair1: 3,0 -> {0,3}\n- Pair2: 0,3 -> {0,3}\n- Pair3: 3,0 -> {0,3}\n- Pair4: 0,0 -> {0}\n- Pair5: 0,2 -> {0,2}\n- Pair6: 0,2 -> {0,2}\n\nOutput row3: 5 0 0 5 0 0 0. Output 5 at col0,3. That is pairs 0,3. Pair0 has {0,3}. Pair3 has {0,3}. So rule: output 5 at pairs that contain 3. That matches. Row1 had 5 at pair3, which had {2,3}. Pair5 had {0}. So not.\n\nRow4 input: 0 3 3 0 3 0 3 0 2 2 2 0 2 0.\n\nPairs:\n\n- Pair0: 0,3 -> {0,3}\n- Pair1: 3,0 -> {0,3}\n- Pair2: 0,3 -> {0,3}\n- Pair3: 3,0 -> {0,3}\n- Pair4: 2,2 -> {2}\n- Pair5: 2,0 -> {0,2}\n- Pair6: 2,0 -> {0,2}\n\nOutput row4: 5 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output 5 at col0 only. That is pair0 with {0,3}. So rule: output 5 at pairs that contain 3? Pair0 has 3. Pair1 has 3 but output 0. So fails.\n\nSo far, no simple rule emerges.\n\nLet's examine the output grids in more detail. Maybe the output grid is the \"difference\" between the positions of 3 and 2, or maybe it's the shape of 3's or 2's compressed.\n\nObservations:\n\n- The output grid is always 4 rows high. The input grid is always 4 rows high. So the transformation preserves height but compresses width by factor 2.\n\n- The output grid uses only colors 0 and 5. So 5 marks some pattern derived from 3 and 2.\n\n- In each example, the positions of 5 in the output grid are somewhat symmetrical or reflect some pattern.\n\nLet's analyze each example's output in terms of coordinates of 5 relative to input 3 and 2.\n\nMaybe the rule: For each column pair (2j, 2j+1) in input, we look at the pattern of 3 and 2 across the four rows. Then we produce output cell 5 if the pattern matches some \"target\" pattern (like a vertical line of 3's or something). Let's examine.\n\nFor each pair, we can create a 4x2 matrix of colors. For each pair, we can encode as a 4x2 binary vector: 1 if color is 3, 2 if color is 2, 0 otherwise. Then we can compute some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: For each pair, if the two columns contain a vertical line of 3's in the same rows (i.e., both columns have 3 in the same row), then output 5? Let's test.\n\nExample1 row1: pair0: col0 has 0, col1 has 0. No vertical 3. pair1: col2 has 3, col3 has 3 in row1? Actually row1 col2=3, col3=3. So vertical line of 3's across two columns in row1. That might produce output 5? But output row1 col1=0. So no.\n\nMaybe rule: For each pair, if either column has a 3 in any row, output 5? But pair0 had 3 at row2,3. Output row2 col0=0. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: For each pair, if the two columns together contain at least one 3 and at least one 2, output 5? Let's test.\n\nExample1 row1: pair3: col6=3, col7=2 -> contains 3 and 2 -> output 5? Output row1 col3=0. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: For each pair, if the two columns together contain 3 and 2 but no 0? That would be pair3: col6=3, col7=2. Output 5? No.\n\nMaybe rule: For each pair, if the two columns contain a 3 and a 2 in adjacent rows (vertical adjacency)? Not.\n\nLet's examine Example2 row1 again. Output row1 5 at col3. Pair3: columns 6-7: input row1 col6=0, col7=2. So pair3 contains 2 but no 3. Output 5 at col3. So maybe rule: output 5 at pair that contains a 2 in the right column? But pair3 has 2 in right column. But pair5: columns 10-11: input row1 col10=0, col11=2. So pair5 also contains 2 in right column. But output row1 col5=0. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at pair that contains a 2 in the right column and the left column is 0? Pair3: left col6=0, right col7=2. Pair5: left col10=0, right col11=2. So both match. But output row1 col5=0. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at pair that contains a 2 in the right column and the left column is 0 and the right column is the last 2 in the row? Let's check: Row1: 2's at col7, col11, col12, col13. The pair3 covers col6-7: right col7 is first 2. Pair5 covers col10-11: right col11 is second 2. Pair6 covers col12-13: right col13 is third 2. Output 5 at col3 only, not at col5 or col6. So rule might be: output 5 at the first pair that contains a 2 in the right column? That would be pair3. That matches output row1. But row2: output 5 at col5. Row2 has 2 at col7 and col13. The first pair with a 2 in right column is pair3 (cols6-7). But output row2 col5 (pair5). So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at pair that contains a 2 in the right column and the left column is 0 and the pair index equals the index of the preceding 3? This seems too complicated.\n\nLet's analyze the output positions in each example more systematically.\n\nWe can create a mapping from output coordinates to input coordinates (maybe pair mapping) and see which input cells correspond to output 5.\n\nLet's list for each example the coordinates of 5 in output and the coordinates of input cells that might be associated.\n\nExample1 output 5 positions:\n\nRow2: col1-4, col6\nRow3: col1, col6\nRow4: col0,1,2\n\nSo output 5 positions:\n\n(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,6)\n(3,1),(3,6)\n(4,0),(4,1),(4,2)\n\nNow let's examine input cells that might correspond to these output positions. For each output coordinate (row, col), maybe we look at input columns 2*col and 2*col+1? Let's compute:\n\nFor output col1: input cols 2 and 3. For output col2: input cols 4 and 5. For output col3: input cols 6 and 7. For output col4: input cols 8 and 9. For output col6: input cols 12 and 13. For output col0: input cols 0 and 1. For output col2: input cols 4 and 5? Wait output col2 we have 0 at row3, so not 5. But output col2 at row4 is 0? Wait row4 output col2=0? Actually output row4: 5 5 5 0 0 0 0. So row4 col2=5. So output col2 at row4. So input cols 4 and 5.\n\nSo maybe we map output col j to input columns 2j and 2j+1. Let's test.\n\nFor output row2 col1=5: input cols 2 and 3. Input row2 col2=0, col3=0. So both 0. So output 5 at pair of zeros. For output row2 col2=5: input cols 4,5: row2 col4=0, col5=3. So pair 0 and 3. For output row2 col3=5: input cols 6,7: row2 col6=0, col7=2. So pair 0 and 2. For output row2 col4=5: input cols 8,9: row2 col8=0, col9=0. So pair 0,0. For output row2 col6=5: input cols 12,13: row2 col12=0, col13=0. So pair 0,0.\n\nRow3: output col1=5: input cols 2,3: row3 col2=0, col3=3. So pair 0,3. Output col6=5: input cols 12,13: row3 col12=2, col13=2? Wait row3 col12=2? Let's check row3 input: \"3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0\". So col12=2, col13=0. So pair 2,0. So output 5 at pair (2,0).\n\nRow4: output col0=5: input cols 0,1: row4 col0=0, col1=0. Pair 0,0. Output col1=5: input cols 2,3: row4 col2=0, col3=0. Pair 0,0. Output col2=5: input cols 4,5: row4 col4=0, col5=3. Pair 0,3.\n\nThus, mapping output col j to input cols 2j, 2j+1 seems plausible. Let's test with Example2.\n\nExample2 mapping: output col j -> input cols 2j,2j+1.\n\nLet's compute output row1: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. Output 5 at col3. Input cols 6,7: row1 col6=0, col7=2. Pair 0,2. So output 5 at pair (0,2). Row1 also has 3 at col5 and 2 at col7. So pair (0,2). So output 5 at pair with 0 and 2. Row1 has other pairs: col5 (output 0) corresponds to input cols 10,11: row1 col10=0, col11=2. Pair (0,2). So output 0 at pair (0,2). So not consistent.\n\nLet's examine output row2: 0 0 0 0 0 5 0. Output 5 at col5. Input cols 10,11: row2 col10=0, col11=0. Pair (0,0). So output 5 at pair (0,0). Row2 has 3 at col6, 2 at col7. Input cols 12,13: row2 col12=0, col13=2. Pair (0,2). Output 0 at col6. So output 5 at pair (0,0) but not at pair (0,2). Row2 also has 3 at col1-4. Input cols 2,3: row2 col2=3, col3=3. Pair (3,3). Output 0 at col1. So output 0 at pair (3,3). So rule not simple.\n\nLet's examine Example3 mapping.\n\nExample3 output row4: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0. Output 5 at col3,4,5. Input cols for col3: 6,7: row4 col6=3, col7=2. Pair (3,2). Col4: 8,9: row4 col8=2, col9=0. Pair (2,0). Col5: 10,11: row4 col10=0, col11=0. Pair (0,0). So output 5 at pairs (3,2),(2,0),(0,0). Row4 also has 3 at col0-2. Input cols 0,1: pair (3,3). Output 0 at col0. So rule not.\n\nThus mapping output col j -> input cols 2j,2j+1 may be correct for some examples but not all. But maybe we mis-identified mapping for Example1: maybe output col j corresponds to input col 2j+? Let's check again.\n\nExample1: output col0 corresponds to input cols 0,1. That seems plausible. Output col1 -> input cols 2,3. Output col2 -> input cols 4,5. Output col3 -> input cols 6,7. Output col4 -> input cols 8,9. Output col5 -> input cols 10,11. Output col6 -> input cols 12,13.\n\nNow check Example2: output col0 -> input cols 0,1. Row1: input col0=3, col1=3. Output row1 col0=0. So output 0 at pair (3,3). Row1 output col1=0 -> input cols 2,3: row1 col2=3, col3=0. Pair (3,0). Output 0. Row1 output col2=0 -> input cols 4,5: row1 col4=0, col5=3. Pair (0,3). Output 0. Row1 output col3=5 -> input cols 6,7: row1 col6=0, col7=2. Pair (0,2). Output 5. Row1 output col4=0 -> input cols 8,9: row1 col8=0, col9=0. Pair (0,0). Output 0. Row1 output col5=0 -> input cols 10,11: row1 col10=0, col11=2. Pair (0,2). Output 0. Row1 output col6=0 -> input cols 12,13: row1 col12=2, col13=2. Pair (2,2). Output 0.\n\nSo mapping holds: output col j corresponds to input cols 2j,2j+1. So we can use this mapping to analyze all examples.\n\nThus the transformation likely compresses horizontally by grouping columns in pairs (2j,2j+1). Then for each pair we compute some rule that outputs 0 or 5 for each row. So the output is a 4x7 grid.\n\nNow we need to find the rule that maps the pair to 0 or 5 for each row.\n\nSo for each row, we have a 4x14 input. For each row, we group columns into 7 pairs: (0,1),(2,3),(4,5),(6,7),(8,9),(10,11),(12,13). For each pair, we produce a single output cell for that row: either 0 or 5.\n\nThus we need to find a rule that given the two input cells in a pair (color values maybe 0,2,3) for a given row, outputs 0 or 5.\n\nLet's examine Example1 row2 (the only row with many 5's). For each pair:\n\nRow2 input: 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nPairs:\n\n- Pair0: (3,0) -> output 0\n- Pair1: (0,0) -> output 5\n- Pair2: (0,3) -> output 5\n- Pair3: (0,2) -> output 5\n- Pair4: (0,0) -> output 5\n- Pair5: (0,0) -> output 0\n- Pair6: (0,0) -> output 5\n\nSo mapping: (3,0) -> 0; (0,0) -> 5; (0,3) -> 5; (0,2) -> 5; (0,0) -> 5; (0,0) -> 0; (0,0) -> 5.\n\nSo rule: output 5 for (0,0) except pair5? Actually pair5 also (0,0) but output 0. So not simply (0,0). Also pair0 (3,0) output 0, but pair2 (0,3) output 5. So maybe rule: output 5 if the pair contains 3 or 2 but the 3 or 2 is on the right side? Let's check:\n\n- Pair0: (3,0): 3 on left, 0 on right -> output 0\n- Pair1: (0,0): no 3/2 -> output 5\n- Pair2: (0,3): 3 on right -> output 5\n- Pair3: (0,2): 2 on right -> output 5\n- Pair4: (0,0): no 3/2 -> output 5\n- Pair5: (0,0): no 3/2 -> output 0\n- Pair6: (0,0): no 3/2 -> output 5\n\nSo rule: output 5 if 3 or 2 is on the right side of the pair OR if no 3/2. But pair5 contradicts: no 3/2 but output 0.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 if 3 or 2 is on the right side OR if the pair is not the 5th pair? But pair5 is the 5th pair? Actually pairs indices: 0-6. Pair5 is index 5. Output 0 at pair5. So maybe output 0 at pair5 only? But that seems arbitrary.\n\nLet's examine Example1 row3: Input row3: 3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0\n\nPairs:\n\n- Pair0: (3,0) -> output 0\n- Pair1: (0,0) -> output 5\n- Pair2: (0,3) -> output 0\n- Pair3: (3,0) -> output 0\n- Pair4: (0,0) -> output 0\n- Pair5: (0,0) -> output 0\n- Pair6: (0,0) -> output 5\n\nWait output row3: 0 5 0 0 0 0 5. So pair1 output 5, pair6 output 5. Others 0.\n\nNow check pair1: (0,0) -> output 5. Pair6: (0,0) -> output 5. Pair0: (3,0) -> 0. Pair2: (0,3) -> 0. Pair3: (3,0) -> 0. Pair4: (0,0) -> 0. Pair5: (0,0) -> 0.\n\nSo rule: output 5 at pair1 and pair6, which are (0,0). So maybe rule: output 5 at (0,0) pairs if they are at odd indices? Pair1 is odd index 1. Pair6 is even index 6. So not.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at (0,0) pairs if the pair is the first or last pair? Pair1 is not first. Pair6 is last. So not.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at (0,0) pairs if the pair is at index that is a multiple of something? Pair1 index 1, pair6 index 6. So not.\n\nLet's examine Example1 row4: Input row4: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 2 2 0 2\n\nPairs:\n\n- Pair0: (0,0) -> output 5\n- Pair1: (0,0) -> output 5\n- Pair2: (0,0) -> output 5\n- Pair3: (3,0) -> output 0\n- Pair4: (0,0) -> output 0\n- Pair5: (2,2) -> output 0\n- Pair6: (0,2) -> output 0\n\nOutput row4: 5 5 5 0 0 0 0. So pairs 0,1,2 output 5. Pairs 3-6 output 0.\n\nNow pairs 0-2 are all (0,0). So rule: output 5 at (0,0) pairs at indices 0-2. But earlier row3 had (0,0) pairs at indices 1,4,5,6, but only 1 and 6 output 5. So not.\n\nSo rule is not simply based on pair content.\n\nLet's examine Example2 row1: Input row1: 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\n\nPairs:\n\n- Pair0: (3,3) -> output 0\n- Pair1: (3,0) -> output 0\n- Pair2: (0,3) -> output 0\n- Pair3: (0,2) -> output 5\n- Pair4: (0,0) -> output 0\n- Pair5: (0,2) -> output 0\n- Pair6: (2,2) -> output 0\n\nSo rule: output 5 only at pair3: (0,2). So maybe rule: output 5 if the pair contains a 2 in the right column and the left column is 0? Pair3 fits: left 0, right 2. Pair5 also has left 0, right 2, but output 0. So why difference? Let's check pair5: left 0, right 2. Output 0. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 if the pair contains a 2 in the right column and the right column is the first 2 in that row? Let's check row1: 2's at col7, col11, col12, col13. Pair3 covers col6-7: right 2 at col7, which is the first 2. Pair5 covers col10-11: right 2 at col11, which is not the first 2 (col7 is earlier). So rule: output 5 at pair where right 2 is the first 2 in that row. That matches pair3. Let's test with other rows.\n\nExample2 row2: Input row2: 0 3 3 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 2. 2's at col7,13. First 2 at col7. Pair3 covers col6-7: left 3, right 2. That pair has 2 on right. Output row2: 5 at col5 (pair5). So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: output 5 at pair where the right column is 2 and the left column is 0 AND the pair index is odd? Pair3 index 3 odd. Pair5 index 5 odd. But pair5 output 0. So fails.\n\nLet's examine Example2 row3: Input row3: 0 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 2 2 0 2 2. 2's at col9,10,12,13. First 2 at col9. Pair4 covers col8-9: left 0, right 2. Output row3: 5 at col0,1. So rule fails.\n\nSo rule not that.\n\nLet's analyze Example3 row4: Input row4: 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. 2's at col7,8. First 2 at col7. Pair3 covers col6-7: left 3, right 2. Output row4: 5 at col3,4,5. So rule fails.\n\nThus, mapping output col j -> input cols 2j,2j+1 is correct, but the rule to output 5 depends on more context than just the two cells.\n\nMaybe we need to consider the whole row's pattern of 3's and 2's to decide which pairs produce 5. For example, maybe we look at the pattern of 3's and 2's across the entire row and then mark 5 at the positions that are \"between\" two 3's or \"between\" a 3 and a 2, but we compress horizontally. So maybe the 5's correspond to the cells between 3's and 2's in the original grid, but then we compress horizontally. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nWe hypothesize: The output 5's mark the cells that in the input grid lie between two 3's horizontally or between a 3 and a 2 horizontally. Then we compress horizontally by mapping each pair of input columns to one output column. But if the 5 cell lies in a pair that contains both columns, we mark that output column as 5. That is, for each pair, if any of the input cells in that pair would be a 5 in the uncompressed version, we mark output 5. So we need to find the pattern of 5's in the uncompressed version (original width 14). Then compress by grouping columns into pairs: if any of the two columns has a 5, output 5.\n\nLet's test this on Example1.\n\nWe need to compute the uncompressed pattern of 5's: For each row, find the cells that lie between two 3's or between a 3 and a 2. Then compress.\n\nLet's compute for Example1 row2: Input row2: 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. Gaps:\n\n- Between 3 at col0 and 3 at col5: cells col1-4. These cells would be 5 in uncompressed version.\n- Between 3 at col5 and 2 at col7: cell col6 would be 5.\n\nSo uncompressed 5 positions: col1,2,3,4,6.\n\nNow compress horizontally by grouping columns 0-1,2-3,4-5,6-7,8-9,10-11,12-13.\n\nNow we see which pairs contain any 5: Pair0: cols0-1: contains col1 which is 5 -> output 5. But output row2 col0 is 0. So fails. Wait pair0 has col1=5, but output row2 col0=0. So rule fails.\n\nBut maybe we compress by grouping columns 0-1 into output col0, but we treat each pair's two input columns as one output column. But if any of the two input columns has a 5, we output 5. That would produce output 5 at pair0 because col1 is 5. But output row2 col0 is 0. So maybe we mis-identified the grouping mapping: maybe output col0 corresponds to input cols 0-? Wait we assumed output col j -> input cols 2j,2j+1. That seems consistent with Example1 row2: output col1=5 corresponds to input cols 2,3: but uncompressed 5 at col1-4. So output col1 (pair 1) would correspond to input cols 2-3, which includes col2,3. Those are 5 in uncompressed. So output 5 at col1 is correct. Output col2 corresponds to input cols 4-5: includes col4=5, col5=3. So output 5 at col2 is correct. Output col3 corresponds to input cols 6-7: includes col6=5, col7=2. So output 5 at col3 is correct. Output col4 corresponds to input cols 8-9: includes col8=0, col9=0. So no 5. Output col4 is 0. Output col5 corresponds to input cols 10-11: includes col10=0, col11=0. So no 5. Output col5 is 0. Output col6 corresponds to input cols 12-13: includes col12=0, col13=0. So no 5. Output col6 is 5? Wait output row2 col6=5. But input cols 12-13 have no 5. So rule fails.\n\nBut maybe we mis-saw output row2 col6: Actually output row2: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5. So col6=5. That would correspond to input cols 12-13, which had no 5. So maybe we mis-evaluated uncompressed 5 positions. Maybe there is a 5 at col12 or col13? Let's check row2 input: 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. There is no 3 or 2 at col12 or 13. So no 5. So rule fails.\n\nThus our hypothesis that output 5's correspond to cells between 3's or 3-2 may be partially correct but not for the last pair.\n\nLet's examine row2 uncompressed 5 positions: col1-4,6. That covers pairs 1,2,3. Pair6 has no 5. But output row2 has 5 at pair6. So something else.\n\nLet's examine row3 uncompressed 5 positions: Input row3: 3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0. Gaps:\n\n- Between 3 at col0 and 3 at col3: cells col1,2. So 5 at col1,2.\n- Between 3 at col3 and 3 at col4: adjacent, no gap.\n- Between 3 at col4 and 2 at col9: cells col5-8. So 5 at col5,6,7,8.\n- Between 2 at col9 and 2 at col10: adjacent, no gap.\n- Between 2 at col10 and 2 at col11: adjacent, no gap.\n- Between 2 at col11 and 2 at col12: adjacent, no gap.\n- Between 2 at col12 and 0 at col13: no 2.\n\nSo uncompressed 5 positions: col1,2,5,6,7,8.\n\nNow compress by pairs: pairs 0-1: includes col1 -> output 5 at pair0. Output row3 col0=0? Wait output row3: 0 5 0 0 0 0 5. So pair0 output 0. So rule fails.\n\nThus our hypothesis fails.\n\nMaybe the output 5's correspond to the positions of 3's in the input, but with some transformation. Let's examine Example1: Output 5 positions: row2 col1-4,6. Row2 input has 3 at col0 and 3 at col5. So output 5 at col1-4,6. That seems like output 5's are at positions between 3's? But also at col6, which is between 3 at col5 and 2 at col7. So maybe output 5's correspond to cells that are adjacent to a 3? Let's test.\n\nRow2 input: 3 at col0, 3 at col5, 2 at col7. Adjacent to 3: cells adjacent to col0: col1; adjacent to col5: col4 and col6; adjacent to col7: col6 and col8. So adjacent cells: col1,4,6,8. Output 5 at col1,2,3,4,6. So includes col1,4,6 but also includes col2,3. So output includes all cells adjacent to 3 at col5? That would be col4 and col6. But also includes col2,3, which are two cells away from 3 at col5. So maybe output 5's are all cells that are within distance 1 from a 3? But then row2 col2,3 are distance 2 from col5? Wait col5-2=3: distance 2. So not.\n\nMaybe output 5's are all cells that are adjacent to a 3 or 2? Let's test.\n\nRow2 input: 3 at col0,3 at col5,2 at col7. Adjacent to any of them: col1 (adjacent to 3 at col0), col4 (adjacent to 3 at col5), col6 (adjacent to both 3 at col5 and 2 at col7), col8 (adjacent to 2 at col7). So adjacent cells: col1,4,6,8. Output 5 at col1,2,3,4,6. So includes col1,4,6 but also col2,3. So not.\n\nMaybe output 5's are all cells that are within distance 2 from a 3? That would include col1,2,3,4,6? Let's see: distance <=2 from col0: cells col1,2. Distance <=2 from col5: cells col3,4,6,7,8? Actually distance <=2 from col5: cells col3,4,5,6,7,8. So union: col1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. But output 5 at col1-4,6. So includes col1-4,6 but not col5,7,8. So not.\n\nMaybe output 5's are cells that are part of a \"gap\" between 3's and 3-2? But we already considered that.\n\nLet's analyze Example1 row3: output 5 at col1 and 6. Input row3: 3 at col0,3 at col3,3 at col4,2 at col9-12. Gaps: between col0 and col3: col1,2. Between col4 and col9: col5-8. So 5's at col1,6. So output includes col1 (gap between col0 and col3) but not col2. It includes col6 (gap between col4 and col9). So maybe rule: output 5 at the middle of the gap between 3's and 3-2? Let's test: Gap between col0 and col3: cells col1,2. Middle cell maybe col1.5? But choose leftmost or rightmost? The rule might choose the leftmost of the gap? That would be col1. That matches. Gap between col4 and col9: cells col5,6,7,8. Middle cells: col6,7. Choose leftmost of the two: col6. That matches output. So rule: output 5 at the leftmost of the two middle cells of a gap of even length? Wait gap length 4 cells: leftmost of two middle cells is col6. So that matches. Gap length 2 cells: leftmost of two middle cells is col1. So that matches. So rule: for each gap between a 3 and a 3 or a 3 and a 2, output 5 at the leftmost of the two middle cells of the gap (if the gap length is even). If the gap length is odd, there is a single middle cell. So output 5 at that middle cell. This would produce output 5 at col1 for gap length 2 (col1-2). Output 5 at col6 for gap length 4 (col5-8). This matches row3.\n\nNow test row2: Input row2: 3 at col0,3 at col5,2 at col7. Gaps:\n\n- Gap between col0 and col5: cells col1-4. Gap length 4. Middle cells: col2,3. Leftmost of two middle cells: col2. But output row2 has 5 at col1-4, not just col2. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe row2 has a gap of length 4 but we output all cells? That contradicts row3.\n\nLet's examine row2 more: Input row2: 3 at col0,3 at col5. Gap length 4. According to rule, output 5 at col2. But output row2 has 5 at col1-4. So maybe rule: if the gap is between two 3's that are far apart (distance > something), we fill entire gap? But row3 gap length 4 between 3 at col4 and 2 at col9, we only output one cell. So rule not.\n\nMaybe rule: if the gap is between 3 and 3, we fill entire gap? Let's test: row2 gap between col0 and col5: both 3's. Output 5 at col1-4: entire gap. Row3 has gap between col4 and col9: 3 and 2. Output only one cell. So rule: fill entire gap between two 3's, but only one cell between 3 and 2. That seems plausible. Let's test with other examples.\n\nExample1 row2 also had a gap between 3 at col5 and 2 at col7: cells col6. That's a 3-2 gap of length 1. Output 5 at col6. That matches rule: one cell between 3 and 2. So rule: For each gap between two 3's, fill entire gap with 5. For each gap between a 3 and a 2, fill only one cell (maybe the cell adjacent to the 3 or the 2? But we need to decide which cell). In row2, gap between 3 at col5 and 2 at col7: only cell col6. So output 5 at col6. That matches rule.\n\nNow row3: Gap between 3 at col0 and 3 at col3: cells col1,2. According to rule, fill entire gap: col1,2. But output only col1. So rule fails.\n\nWait row3 gap between 3 at col0 and 3 at col3: both 3's. According to rule, fill entire gap with 5. But output only col1. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe we mis-identified the gap: maybe there is a 3 at col3 and 3 at col4 adjacent, so maybe the gap between col0 and col4? But col0-4 includes col1-3: cells col1,2,3. But there is a 3 at col3, so the gap between col0 and col4 is not contiguous because there's a 3 at col3. But we might consider the gap between col0 and col4 as separated by a 3 at col3. So we might not fill that gap.\n\nBut maybe the rule: fill gaps between 3's that are separated by at least one 0? But col0 and col3 have zeros at col1,2. So they are separated by zeros. So we fill entire gap? But output only col1.\n\nMaybe the rule: fill the leftmost cell of the gap between 3's? But row2 had gap length 4 and output 5 at all cells. So not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: fill the gap between 3's only if there are no other 3's within that gap? But there are no other 3's within col1-4. So we fill entire gap. Row3 gap between col0 and col3: there is no other 3 in col1-2. So we would fill entire gap. But output only col1. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe we mis-evaluated row3 output: Output row3: 0 5 0 0 0 0 5. Actually row3 output col1=5, col6=5. So only col1 and col6. So maybe we mis-copied row3 output. Let's double-check Example1 output: Provided:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 5 5 5 0 5\n0 5 0 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nYes, row3 output is \"0 5 0 0 0 0 5\". So col1 and col6. So indeed only those two.\n\nThus rule: fill entire gap between 3's fails.\n\nLet's examine Example2 row1: Input row1: 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 2. Gaps:\n\n- Gap between 3 at col2 and 3 at col5: cells col3,4. Gap length 2. According to rule: fill entire gap with 5? Output row1: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So output 5 at col3 only, not col4. So we didn't fill entire gap. So rule fails.\n\n- Gap between 3 at col5 and 2 at col7: cell col6. Output row1: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So 5 at col3, not col6. So maybe we mis-identified the gap: maybe we are only marking the leftmost cell of each gap? Let's test: Gap between 3 at col2 and 3 at col5: leftmost cell col3. Output 5 at col3. Gap between 3 at col5 and 2 at col7: leftmost cell col6. Output 5 at col3, not col6. So not.\n\nMaybe rule: only mark the leftmost cell of gaps that are between 3 and 3, but not between 3 and 2? Let's test: Gap between 3 at col2 and 3 at col",
    "3": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze ARC puzzle. The training examples show a transformation. Input grid size: Example 1: input 2x2? Actually example 1 Input:\n0 0\n0 7\nThat's 2 rows, 2 columns. Output is 6x6 grid. Example 2 Input: 3x3 grid. Output: 9x9 grid. Example 3 Input: 5x5 grid. Output: 15x15 grid. Example 4 Input: 4x4 grid. Output: 12x12 grid.\n\nSo transformation: input grid of size N x N (square). Output grid of size 3N x 3N. So we tile the input pattern across a 3x3 grid, but with some modifications: we also insert some 2's maybe? Let's examine.\n\nExample 1: Input:\n0 0\n0 7\n\nPositions: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=7. So only one non-zero element: 7 at bottom-right.\n\nOutput 6x6 grid. Let's print output grid as 6x6:\n\nRow0: 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow1: 0 7 0 7 0 7\nRow2: 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow3: 0 7 0 7 0 7\nRow4: 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow5: 0 7 0 7 0 7\n\nSo pattern: For each 2x2 block of input, we create 3x3 block of output? Wait 2x2 input leads to 6x6 output. So each input cell expands to 3x3 block? Let's check: Input cell at (1,1) = 7. In output, where are 7's? In output, 7's appear at positions (1,1), (1,3), (1,5), (3,1), (3,3), (3,5), (5,1), (5,3), (5,5). That's 9 positions, which is 3x3 grid of 7's. So the 7 at input bottom-right expands to a 3x3 block of 7's in output. The 0's maybe produce pattern of 2's and 0's? Let's examine 0 cells. Input cell (0,0)=0. Where do 0's appear? In output, 0's appear at positions that are not 7 or 2. Let's look at pattern: The output grid has a repeating pattern of 2's and 0's in a 2x3 or 3x2? Let's analyze.\n\nOutput grid:\n\nRow0: 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow1: 0 7 0 7 0 7\nRow2: 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow3: 0 7 0 7 0 7\nRow4: 2 0 2 0 2 0\nRow5: 0 7 0 7 0 7\n\nSo rows alternate: even rows (0,2,4) are 2 0 2 0 2 0 pattern; odd rows (1,3,5) are 0 7 0 7 0 7 pattern.\n\nSimilarly columns: even columns (0,2,4) are 2 or 0? Let's check: column 0 values: 2,0,2,0,2,0 pattern; column 1 values: 0,7,0,7,0,7 pattern; column 2: 2,0,2,0,2,0; column 3: 0,7,0,7,0,7; etc. So it's a repeating pattern of 2's and 0's in even rows/cols, and 7's in odd rows/cols.\n\nBut the 7's appear in a 3x3 block at positions where both row and column indices are odd (1,3,5). So the 7's are at positions where both coordinates are odd numbers. The 2's appear at positions where both coordinates are even numbers. The 0's appear at positions where row is odd and column is even? Wait row odd, col even => 0; row even, col odd => 0. Yes. So it's a checkerboard pattern with 2's at even-even, 7's at odd-odd, 0's at cross positions.\n\nBut the input had only one non-zero cell. So the output pattern is a 3x3 grid of that non-zero cell at odd-odd positions. The 2's fill even-even positions. The 0's fill cross positions.\n\nNow example 2: Input 3x3 grid:\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 6\n6 0 0\n\nPositions: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=6, (2,0)=6, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0. So there are two 6's at positions (1,2) and (2,0). Output is 9x9 grid. Let's analyze output.\n\nOutput grid 9x9:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow1: 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\nRow2: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\nRow3: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow4: 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\nRow5: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\nRow6: 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow7: 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\nRow8: 6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n\nWe see pattern repeating every 3 rows and columns. Let's break into 3x3 blocks: The output is a 3x3 tiling of 3x3 blocks. Each 3x3 block corresponds to an input cell? Actually input is 3x3, output is 9x9, so each input cell expands to a 3x3 block.\n\nLet's examine mapping: Input cell (0,0)=0 expands to a 3x3 block at output rows 0-2, cols 0-2. That block is:\n\nRow0-2, Col0-2:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0\nRow1: 0 0 6\nRow2: 6 0 0\n\nWait, that's not a block; we need to look at output rows 0-2, cols 0-2:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0\nRow1: 0 0 6\nRow2: 6 0 0\n\nBut input cell (0,0)=0. So the block is not just zeros. It contains 2's and 6's. That seems to be the same pattern as input but expanded? Wait, the input grid had 0 0 0; 0 0 6; 6 0 0. That pattern is a 3x3 grid. The output block for (0,0) seems to match the input pattern exactly. Let's compare: Input grid:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 6\nRow2: 6 0 0\n\nOutput block (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n\nRow0: 0 2 0\nRow1: 0 0 6\nRow2: 6 0 0\n\nThe difference: In the input, at (0,1) was 0, but output block at (0,1) is 2. So there is a transformation: 0's become 2's in even-even positions? Let's analyze the pattern of 2's in output. In each 3x3 block, there are 3 2's at positions (0,1),(1,0),(2,2)? Wait, let's check block.\n\nBlock coordinates relative to block: (0,0) -> 0, (0,1)->2, (0,2)->0; (1,0)->0, (1,1)->0, (1,2)->6; (2,0)->6, (2,1)->0, (2,2)->0.\n\nSo 2's at (0,1). Are there any other 2's? Let's check other blocks. For block at (0,3) (top-left row0 col3). That block is rows0-2, cols3-5:\n\nRows 0-2, cols3-5:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0\nRow1: 0 0 6\nRow2: 6 0 0\n\nWait row0 col3-5: \"0 2 0\"? Let's check output row0: \"0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\". So col3=0, col4=2, col5=0. Yes. Row1: \"0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\". So col3=0, col4=0, col5=6. Row2: \"6 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\". So col3=6, col4=0, col5=0. So block at (0,3) is identical to block at (0,0). So each 3x3 block is identical to the block at (0,0). So the output is a repetition of the same 3x3 block across the 9x9 grid. Wait but the input had two 6's at (1,2) and (2,0). But the output 9x9 has 6's at many positions. Let's examine the pattern of 6's in output: They appear at positions (1,2),(1,5),(1,8); (4,2),(4,5),(4,8); (7,2),(7,5),(7,8) and also at (2,0),(2,3),(2,6),(5,0),(5,3),(5,6),(8,0),(8,3),(8,6). So 6's appear at positions where both coordinates are multiples of 3? Actually check: (1,2): row 1, col 2. Row 1 mod 3 = 1, col 2 mod 3 = 2. (1,5): row1 mod3=1, col5 mod3=2. So pattern: row mod3=1, col mod3=2. Similarly (2,0): row mod3=2, col mod3=0. So the 6's appear at positions where (row mod3, col mod3) matches either (1,2) or (2,0). These correspond to the positions of 6's in the input grid. Input grid positions: (1,2) and (2,0). So the mapping: For each input cell that is non-zero (value 6), we replicate that value at all positions in output where the relative position (row mod3, col mod3) equals the input cell coordinates (i,j). Similarly, for zeros, we fill with 2's at positions where (row mod3, col mod3) equals some pattern? Let's analyze.\n\nThe 2's appear at positions (0,1),(3,1),(6,1),(0,4),(3,4),(6,4),(0,7),(3,7),(6,7). So row mod3=0, col mod3=1. Also at (1,0),(4,0),(7,0),(1,3),(4,3),(7,3),(1,6),(4,6),(7,6). So row mod3=1, col mod3=0. Also at (2,2),(5,2),(8,2),(2,5),(5,5),(8,5),(2,8),(5,8),(8,8). So row mod3=2, col mod3=2. So 2's appear at positions where (row mod3, col mod3) equals (0,1),(1,0),(2,2). These correspond to the zeros in the input grid? Let's check input grid zeros positions: (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2). Wait input grid zeros positions: (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2). Actually (2,0) is 6, (1,2) is 6. So zeros at (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2). So 7 zeros. In output, 2's appear at positions corresponding to those zeros? Let's see mapping: For each zero at input coordinate (i,j), we replicate 2 at positions where (row mod3, col mod3) = (i,j). Let's check: Input zero at (0,0) -> output 2 at positions (0,0),(3,0),(6,0),(0,3),(3,3),(6,3),(0,6),(3,6),(6,6). Are there 2's at those positions? Let's check output: row0 col0=0? Wait output row0 col0=0. So no. Wait maybe I'm misreading. Let's check output row0: \"0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\". So row0 col0=0, col1=2, col2=0, col3=0, col4=2, col5=0, col6=0, col7=2, col8=0. So 2's at col1, col4, col7. So row0 col0=0. So not matching.\n\nLet's analyze pattern more systematically. The output 9x9 is basically a repetition of a 3x3 block across the grid. That 3x3 block is exactly the same as the input grid but with zeros replaced by 2's at some positions? Let's examine the 3x3 block at top-left: rows0-2, cols0-2:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0\nRow1: 0 0 6\nRow2: 6 0 0\n\nInput grid: rows0-2, cols0-2:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 6\nRow2: 6 0 0\n\nSo the only difference is that input had 0 at (0,1) but output has 2 at (0,1). Input had 0 at (0,0) but output has 0 at (0,0). Input had 0 at (0,2) but output has 0 at (0,2). So 2 appears only at (0,1). Let's examine other zeros: (1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2). Output has 0 at (1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2). So only one zero replaced by 2. Which zero? The one at (0,1). So maybe the rule: For each input grid, find the non-zero values (like 7,6,8,5). Then replicate them across the output grid at positions where row mod N equals column mod N? Wait no.\n\nLet's analyze Example 3. Input 5x5 grid:\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n\nPositions: (1,1)=8, (2,1)=8. So two 8's at coordinates (1,1) and (2,1). Output grid 15x15. Let's examine output.\n\nGiven output lines:\n\nRow0: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow5: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow6: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow7: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow10: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow11: 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\nRow12: 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the pattern: 15x15 grid with repeating blocks of 5x5? Actually 15x15 is 3*5. So each input cell expands to a 5x5 block? Wait input 5x5, output 15x15. So each input cell expands to a 5x5 block. Let's check mapping.\n\nInput cell (1,1)=8. That expands to a 5x5 block at output rows 5-9? Wait we need to find which block contains the 8's. Let's check output rows 1-? Actually row1 has 8 at col1 and col6 and col11. Row1: \"2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\". So 8 at col1,6,11. Row6: same. Row11: same. So 8's appear at positions (1,1),(1,6),(1,11),(6,1),(6,6),(6,11),(11,1),(11,6),(11,11). So it's a 3x3 grid of 8's at positions where both row and column indices are 1 mod 5? Actually row indices 1,6,11: each is 1 mod 5. Column indices 1,6,11: each 1 mod 5. So 8's appear at positions where both coordinates are congruent to 1 mod 5. That matches input coordinate (1,1). Input coordinate (2,1)=8. That expands to 8's at positions where row mod5 = 2, col mod5 = 1. Indeed we see 8's at positions (2,1),(2,6),(2,11),(7,1),(7,6),(7,11),(12,1),(12,6),(12,11). Yes. So the pattern: For each non-zero input cell at coordinates (i,j) with value v, we replicate v at all output positions where row mod N = i, col mod N = j. Similarly, for zero cells, we replicate something else? In example 3, there are 2's at positions where row mod5 and col mod5 correspond to zeros that are maybe at (0,0),(0,2),(0,3),(0,4),(1,0),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,0),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(4,0),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4). But output shows 2's at positions (0,0),(0,5),(0,10),(5,0),(5,5),(5,10),(10,0),(10,5),(10,10). Wait check output: row0: 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. So 2's at col0,5,10. Row5: same pattern. Row10: same pattern. So 2's appear at positions where row mod5 = 0 and col mod5 = 0? Actually row0 col0: row mod5=0, col mod5=0. Row0 col5: row mod5=0, col mod5=0? Wait col5 mod5=0. Yes. Row0 col10 mod5=0. So 2's at positions where row mod5=0 and col mod5=0. So 2's correspond to input cell (0,0)=0? But input cell (0,0) is 0. So yes, zeros at (0,0) produce 2's at positions where row mod5=0, col mod5=0. But what about other zeros? For example, input cell (0,1)=0. Does that produce 2's at positions where row mod5=0, col mod5=1? Let's check output: row0 col1=0, row0 col6=0, row0 col11=0, row5 col1=0, row5 col6=0, etc. So no 2's there. So only zeros at (0,0) produce 2's? Wait check input (1,0)=0. That would produce 2's at positions where row mod5=1, col mod5=0. But output shows 2's at row1 col0? Let's check output row1 col0: row1 col0 is 2? Wait row1: \"2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 0\". So row1 col0=2. Yes. So there is a 2 at row1 col0. That corresponds to input cell (1,0) which is 0. So zeros at (1,0) produce 2's at positions where row mod5=1, col mod5=0. Similarly, zeros at (2,0) produce 2's at row2 col0? Let's check row2 col0: row2: \"0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\". So row2 col0=0. So no 2. Wait row2 col0 is 0, not 2. So maybe zeros at (2,0) produce 2's at row2 col0? But row2 col0 is 0. So maybe zeros at (2,0) produce 2's at positions where row mod5=2, col mod5=0? Let's check output at row2 col0: row2 col0=0. So no 2. So maybe zeros at (2,0) produce 2's at positions where row mod5=2, col mod5=0? But no. Let's check other zeros: input (3,0)=0. That would produce 2's at row3 col0? Row3 col0=0. So no. Input (4,0)=0. That would produce 2's at row4 col0? Row4 col0=0. So no.\n\nThus not all zeros produce 2's. Which zeros produce 2's? Let's list all 2's in output: They appear at positions where row mod5=0, col mod5=0 (like (0,0),(0,5),(0,10),(5,0),(5,5),(5,10),(10,0),(10,5),(10,10)) and also at positions where row mod5=1, col mod5=0 (like (1,0),(6,0),(11,0)). Are there any other 2's? Let's check row1 col5? Row1 col5=2. Row1 col10=2. So row1 col5: row1 mod5=1, col5 mod5=0. Row1 col10: row1 mod5=1, col10 mod5=0. So indeed 2's at row1 mod5=1, col mod5=0. Row6 col5=2, row6 col10=2. Row11 col5=2, row11 col10=2. So 2's at positions where row mod5=1 and col mod5=0. So 2's appear at positions where col mod5=0 and row mod5=0 or 1. Wait row mod5=0 or 1? Actually row mod5=0 and 1 produce 2's. Are there 2's at row mod5=2? No. So 2's appear at positions where col mod5=0 and row mod5=0 or 1. But also at row mod5=0, col mod5=0. So basically all positions where col mod5=0 produce 2's, except maybe some where row mod5=2? Wait check row2 col0: row2 mod5=2, col0 mod5=0. Row2 col0 is 0. So not 2. So not all col mod5=0 produce 2's. So rule is more specific.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern of 2's in example 3. The 2's form a 3x3 grid at positions where both coordinates are multiples of 5? Actually 2's at positions (0,0),(0,5),(0,10),(5,0),(5,5),(5,10),(10,0),(10,5),(10,10). That's a 3x3 grid of 2's at positions where both row and column are multiples of 5. So 2's at positions where row mod5=0 and col mod5=0. But we also saw 2's at positions (1,0),(6,0),(11,0),(1,5),(6,5),(11,5),(1,10),(6,10),(11,10). Those are positions where row mod5=1 and col mod5=0. So 2's at positions where col mod5=0 and row mod5=0 or 1. But maybe the rule is: For each input cell that is zero, we replicate the value 2 at positions where row mod N equals input row index, but only for certain columns? Wait we need to find a consistent rule across all examples.\n\nLet's analyze example 4. Input 4x4 grid:\n\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0\n\nPositions: (1,2)=5, (3,1)=5. Output 12x12 grid. Let's examine pattern.\n\nOutput grid 12x12:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0\nRow2: 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0\nRow4: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0\nRow6: 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow7: 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0\nRow8: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow9: 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0\nRow10: 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow11: 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0\n\nSo pattern: 12x12 is 3*4. So each input cell expands to a 4x4 block. Let's analyze mapping. Input cell (1,2)=5. That expands to 5's at positions where row mod4=1, col mod4=2. Let's check output: 5's at positions (1,2),(1,6),(1,10),(5,2),(5,6),(5,10),(9,2),(9,6),(9,10). Yes, those are positions where row mod4=1 and col mod4=2. Input cell (3,1)=5 expands to 5's at positions where row mod4=3, col mod4=1. Output: 5's at (3,1),(3,5),(3,9),(7,1),(7,5),(7,9),(11,1),(11,5),(11,9). Yes. So rule: For each non-zero input cell value v at (i,j), replicate v at positions where row mod N = i and col mod N = j.\n\nNow what about 2's? In example 4, 2's appear at positions where row mod4=0 and col mod4=1? Wait check row0 col1=2. Row0 mod4=0, col1 mod4=1. Row0 col5=2. Row0 col9=2. Row4 col1=2, row4 col5=2, row4 col9=2. Row8 col1=2, row8 col5=2, row8 col9=2. So 2's appear at positions where row mod4=0, col mod4=1. Also at positions where row mod4=2, col mod4=0? Let's check row2 col0=2. Row2 mod4=2, col0 mod4=0. Row2 col4=2. Row2 col8=2. Row6 col0=2. Row6 col4=2. Row6 col8=2. Row10 col0=2. Row10 col4=2. Row10 col8=2. So 2's at row mod4=2, col mod4=0. Also at row mod4=0, col mod4=1. So 2's appear at positions where (row mod4, col mod4) = (0,1) or (2,0). Also maybe at positions (1,0)? Let's check row1 col0=0, row1 col4=0, row1 col8=0. So no 2's. So 2's appear at positions where (row mod4, col mod4) equals (0,1) or (2,0). These correspond to zeros at input positions? Let's see input zeros at (0,1) and (2,0). Input zeros at (0,1)=0, (2,0)=0. Yes. So zeros at those positions produce 2's at positions where row mod4 = input row index, col mod4 = input col index. So the rule for zeros: For each zero input cell, we replicate 2 at positions where row mod N = input row index, col mod N = input col index. But earlier we saw zeros at (0,0) produce 2's at positions where row mod5=0, col mod5=0. That matches this rule: input zero at (0,0) -> output 2 at positions where row mod5=0, col mod5=0. Yes. So the rule is consistent: For each input cell with any value (including zero), we replicate a value at positions where row mod N = input row index, col mod N = input col index. But the value we replicate depends on whether the input cell is zero or non-zero. If input cell is zero, we replicate the color 2. If input cell is non-zero, we replicate the same color value (the same as input). That seems to hold for all examples: Example 1: input zero at (0,0) -> 2 at positions where row mod2=0, col mod2=0. Output 2's at (0,0),(2,0),(4,0),(0,2),(2,2),(4,2),(0,4),(2,4),(4,4). Wait check: In output example 1, 2's at positions: (0,0),(0,2),(0,4),(2,0),(2,2),(2,4),(4,0),(4,2),(4,4). Yes, matches. Input zero at (0,1) -> 2 at positions where row mod2=0, col mod2=1. In output example 1, 2's at positions (0,1)? Actually output row0 col1=0. So not 2. Wait row0 col1 is 0. So no 2. Wait row2 col1? Row2 col1=0. So no 2. So zeros at (0,1) do not produce 2's. But our rule says they should produce 2's. So maybe rule is only for zeros that are part of some pattern? Let's examine zeros at (0,1) in example 1. Input zero at (0,1) does not produce any 2's. But input zero at (1,0) also does not produce 2's? Wait input zero at (1,0) is at (1,0). Output positions with row mod2=1, col mod2=0: (1,0),(1,2),(1,4),(3,0),(3,2),(3,4),(5,0),(5,2),(5,4). In output example 1, at (1,0) we have 0, not 2. At (1,2) we have 0? Wait row1 col2=0. Yes. So no 2. So zeros at (0,1) and (1,0) do not produce 2's. But zeros at (0,0) produce 2's. So rule is not simply replicate 2 for all zeros. Let's examine example 2: zeros at input positions: (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2). Output 2's at positions: row0 col1, row0 col4, row0 col7, row3 col1, row3 col4, row3 col7, row6 col1, row6 col4, row6 col7. Also row1 col0? Wait row1 col0=0. So 2's appear at positions where row mod3=0 and col mod3=1? Actually row0 col1: row0 mod3=0, col1 mod3=1. Row0 col4: row0 mod3=0, col4 mod3=1. Row0 col7: row0 mod3=0, col7 mod3=1. Row3 col1: row3 mod3=0, col1 mod3=1. So 2's appear at positions where row mod3=0, col mod3=1. Also row? Wait row1 col0? No. Row1 col0=0. So not 2. Row1 col? Let's check row1 col? Row1 col? Row1 col? Wait row1 col? Let's list all 2's in output example 2: The output grid has 2's at positions: (0,1),(0,4),(0,7),(3,1),(3,4),(3,7),(6,1),(6,4),(6,7). That's all. So 2's appear at positions where row mod3=0, col mod3=1. That's the only 2's. So zeros at input positions (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2). Which of these correspond to (row mod3=0, col mod3=1)? Input coordinates (0,1) is (row0 mod3=0, col1 mod3=1). So input zero at (0,1) would produce 2's at positions where row mod3=0, col mod3=1. That matches the 2's. So zero at (0,1) produced 2's. Zero at (0,0) would produce 2's at positions where row mod3=0, col mod3=0. But we don't see any 2's at those positions. So zero at (0,0) did not produce 2's. Zero at (0,2) would produce 2's at positions row mod3=0, col mod3=2. But we don't see any 2's there. Zero at (1,0) would produce 2's at row mod3=1, col mod3=0. But we don't see any 2's there. Zero at (1,1) would produce 2's at row mod3=1, col mod3=1. Not present. Zero at (2,1) would produce 2's at row mod3=2, col mod3=1. Not present. Zero at (2,2) would produce 2's at row mod3=2, col mod3=2. Not present.\n\nThus only zeros at input positions that correspond to (0,1) produce 2's. So rule may be that we replicate 2 for zeros that are in the same \"color pattern\" as the non-zero cells? Let's analyze further.\n\nLet's examine example 3 again. Input zeros at positions: (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(0,4),(1,0),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,0),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3),(3,4),(4,0),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4). Among these, 2's appear at positions where row mod5=0 and col mod5=0 (i.e., input zero at (0,0)) and also row mod5=1 and col mod5=0 (input zero at (1,0)). So zeros at (0,0) and (1,0) produce 2's. Zeros at other positions do not produce 2's. So rule might be that only zeros at positions where row index is 0 or 1 produce 2's? But not necessarily. Let's examine example 4: zeros at positions: many. 2's appear at positions where row mod4=0 and col mod4=1 (input zero at (0,1)) and row mod4=2 and col mod4=0 (input zero at (2,0)). So zeros at (0,1) and (2,0) produce 2's. So pattern: zeros at positions that are one step away from the non-zero cells? Let's examine the input pattern for each example: In each input, there are two non-zero cells at positions that are not adjacent? Let's examine.\n\nExample 1: Input 2x2: zeros at (0,0),(0,1),(1,0); non-zero at (1,1). So zeros at (0,0),(0,1),(1,0). The 2's appear at positions where row mod2=0, col mod2=0 (input zero at (0,0)) and maybe at (0,1)? Wait we saw 2's at (0,0),(0,2),(0,4),(2,0),(2,2),(2,4),(4,0),(4,2),(4,4). So 2's appear at positions where row mod2=0, col mod2=0. That corresponds to input zero at (0,0). So only zero at (0,0) produced 2's. But there were other zeros at (0,1) and (1,0) that didn't produce 2's. So rule: only zeros at positions that are \"adjacent\" to the non-zero cell? Let's examine. In example 1, non-zero at (1,1). Zero at (0,0) is diagonally adjacent to non-zero? Actually (0,0) is diagonally adjacent to (1,1). Zero at (0,1) is adjacent vertically? Actually (0,1) is adjacent vertically to (1,1). Zero at (1,0) is adjacent horizontally to (1,1). So all zeros are adjacent to the non-zero cell. But only zero at (0,0) produced 2's. So maybe rule: zeros that are in the same \"color pattern\" as the non-zero cells? Let's examine the output pattern for example 1: 2's appear at even-even positions. Non-zero 7's appear at odd-odd positions. 0's appear at cross positions. So 2's appear at positions where both coordinates are even. In input, the zero at (0,0) has both coordinates even. So that zero produced 2's. The zeros at (0,1) and (1,0) have one coordinate even, one odd. So they didn't produce 2's. So rule: For zeros that are at positions where both coordinates are even, we replicate 2. For zeros that are at positions where row and col parity differ, we don't replicate 2. That might be the rule: replicate 2 for zeros that are at positions with same parity as the non-zero cell? But the non-zero cell in example 1 is at (1,1), both odd. The zeros at (0,0) has both even, zeros at (0,1) and (1,0) have one even, one odd. So maybe rule: replicate 2 for zeros at positions that have same parity as the non-zero cell? Let's test: Non-zero cell (1,1) is odd-odd. Zeros at (0,0) are even-even, which is opposite parity. So that doesn't match. So maybe rule: replicate 2 for zeros at positions that are of same parity as the non-zero cell? But (0,0) is not same parity as (1,1). So not that.\n\nLet's examine example 2: Non-zero cells at (1,2) and (2,0). Let's compute parity: (1,2): odd-even. (2,0): even-even. Zeros at (0,1): even-odd. Zeros at (0,0): even-even. Zeros at (0,2): even-even. Zeros at (1,0): odd-even. Zeros at (1,1): odd-odd. Zeros at (2,1): even-odd. Zeros at (2,2): even-even. 2's appear at positions where row mod3=0, col mod3=1. That corresponds to input zero at (0,1) (even-odd). So zero at (0,1) produced 2's. Other zeros didn't produce 2's. So rule: only zero at (0,1) produced 2's. So maybe rule: zeros that are at positions that are \"adjacent\" to a non-zero cell in a specific direction? Let's examine: In input, zero at (0,1) is adjacent (above) to non-zero at (1,1)? Wait non-zero at (1,1) is not present. Actually non-zero at (1,2) and (2,0). So zero at (0,1) is adjacent to non-zero at (1,2) diagonally? (0,1) to (1,2) is diagonal. Zero at (0,1) is also adjacent to non-zero at (2,0)? (0,1) to (2,0) is not adjacent. So maybe not.\n\nLet's examine example 4: Non-zero cells at (1,2) and (3,1). Zeros at (0,1) produce 2's. Zeros at (2,0) produce 2's. So zeros at (0,1) and (2,0). Are these adjacent to the non-zero cells? (0,1) is adjacent to (1,2) diagonally? Actually (0,1) to (1,2) is diagonal. (2,0) is adjacent to (3,1) diagonally. So maybe rule: zeros that are diagonally adjacent to non-zero cells produce 2's. Let's test this on example 1: Non-zero at (1,1). Zero at (0,0) is diagonally adjacent to (1,1). Zero at (0,1) is adjacent vertically. Zero at (1,0) adjacent horizontally. So only diagonal zero produced 2's. That matches: only zero at (0,0) produced 2's. Example 2: Non-zero at (1,2) and (2,0). Let's find zeros that are diagonally adjacent to either non-zero. For (1,2), diagonally adjacent zeros: (0,1),(0,3),(2,1),(2,3). But input has zeros at (0,1),(0,3),(2,1),(2,3)? Input: (0,1)=0, (0,3) is out of bounds (since 3x3 grid, col3 doesn't exist). So ignore. (2,1)=0, (2,3) out of bounds. So zeros at (0,1) and (2,1) are diagonally adjacent to (1,2). For (2,0), diagonally adjacent zeros: (1,-1) out of bounds, (1,1),(3,-1) out of bounds, (3,1) out of bounds. So zero at (1,1) is diagonally adjacent to (2,0). So zeros at (0,1),(2,1),(1,1) are diagonally adjacent to at least one non-zero. But in output, 2's appear only at positions corresponding to (0,1). So not all diagonally adjacent zeros produce 2's. Maybe only zeros that are diagonally adjacent to the non-zero cells and also have some property like being in the same row or column? Let's examine.\n\nIn example 2, 2's appear at positions where row mod3=0 and col mod3=1. That corresponds to input zero at (0,1). So zero at (0,1) produced 2's. Zero at (2,1) (diagonally adjacent to (1,2)) did not produce 2's. Zero at (1,1) (diagonally adjacent to (2,0)) did not produce 2's. So rule is not just diagonally adjacent.\n\nLet's analyze more systematically.\n\nWe have input grid of size N. Output grid of size 3N. For each input cell at coordinates (i,j) with color value v. For each output cell at coordinates (x,y), we check if x mod N = i and y mod N = j. If so, we set output cell to something: either v if v != 0, or 2 if v == 0. That would produce a pattern where all cells that match the modulo condition get the value. Let's test this rule on example 1.\n\nExample 1: N=2. Input cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=7. For each input cell, we fill output cells at positions where x mod 2 = i and y mod 2 = j with value: if v != 0 -> v else 2.\n\n- For input (0,0)=0: fill output cells where x mod2=0, y mod2=0 with value 2. That would be positions: (0,0),(0,2),(0,4),(2,0),(2,2),(2,4),(4,0),(4,2),(4,4). In output, these positions indeed have 2. Good.\n\n- For input (0,1)=0: fill output cells where x mod2=0, y mod2=1 with value 2. That would be positions: (0,1),(0,3),(0,5),(2,1),(2,3),(2,5),(4,1),(4,3),(4,5). But in output, these positions have 0. So rule fails.\n\n- For input (1,0)=0: fill output cells where x mod2=1, y mod2=0 with value 2. That would be positions: (1,0),(1,2),(1,4),(3,0),(3,2),(3,4),(5,0),(5,2),(5,4). In output, these positions have 0. So rule fails.\n\n- For input (1,1)=7: fill output cells where x mod2=1, y mod2=1 with value 7. That yields positions: (1,1),(1,3),(1,5),(3,1),(3,3),(3,5),(5,1),(5,3),(5,5). In output, these positions indeed have 7. Good.\n\nSo the rule works for non-zero cells, but not for zeros except (0,0). So maybe we only apply the rule for non-zero cells, and for zeros we apply some other rule that only fills certain zeros with 2. Let's examine the zeros that get filled with 2: In example 1, only (0,0) zero produced 2. In example 2, only (0,1) zero produced 2. In example 3, zeros at (0,0) and (1,0) produced 2. In example 4, zeros at (0,1) and (2,0) produced 2. So which zeros produce 2? Let's examine patterns.\n\nLet's list the coordinates of zeros that produce 2 in each example:\n\nExample 1: (0,0)\nExample 2: (0,1)\nExample 3: (0,0),(1,0)\nExample 4: (0,1),(2,0)\n\nLet's see if there's a pattern: maybe these zeros are the ones that are at the same column as the first non-zero cell? Let's check.\n\nExample 1: non-zero at (1,1). Zero at (0,0) is not same column or row. So no.\n\nExample 2: non-zeros at (1,2) and (2,0). Zero at (0,1) is not same column or row. So no.\n\nExample 3: non-zeros at (1,1) and (2,1). Zero at (0,0) is not same column. Zero at (1,0) is same row as (1,1)? Actually zero at (1,0) is same row as (1,1). So maybe zeros that are in the same row as a non-zero cell produce 2? Let's test.\n\nExample 3: zeros at (1,0) is same row as (1,1). Zero at (0,0) is not same row. So not.\n\nExample 4: zeros at (0,1) is same column as (1,1)? Wait non-zero at (1,2) and (3,1). Zero at (0,1) is same column as (3,1). Zero at (2,0) is same column as (1,2)? Actually (1,2) column 2, (2,0) column 0. So no.\n\nMaybe zeros that are at positions that are \"aligned\" with the non-zero cells in a certain diagonal direction? Let's examine the coordinates of zeros that produce 2 relative to non-zero cells.\n\nExample 1: Non-zero at (1,1). Zero at (0,0) is one step diagonally up-left from (1,1). So zero at (0,0) is the opposite corner of the 2x2 grid.\n\nExample 2: Non-zero at (1,2) and (2,0). Zero at (0,1) is diagonally adjacent to both? Actually (0,1) is diagonal to (1,2) and also diagonal to (2,0)? Let's check: (0,1) to (1,2) is diagonal. (0,1) to (2,0) is not diagonal, but it's two steps away. So maybe zero at (0,1) is the \"missing\" cell that would complete a diagonal line of 7's? Let's examine input pattern: (1,2)=7, (2,0)=7. If we plot coordinates:\n\n(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)\n(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)\n\nNon-zero at (1,2) and (2,0). So we have 7 at (1,2) and (2,0). The 7's are at positions that are 2 apart horizontally and vertically. They form an \"L\" shape. The zero at (0,1) is at the center of the 3x3 grid? Actually (0,1) is the middle of top row. Maybe the 2's appear at positions that are at the \"center\" of the pattern? Let's analyze the output pattern: The 2's appear at positions (0,1),(0,4),(0,7),(3,1),(3,4),(3,7),(6,1),(6,4),(6,7). That's a grid of 3x3 with 2's at positions where row mod3=0 and col mod3=1. So it's like a pattern of 2's that is offset by (0,1) relative to the 3x3 grid. That offset corresponds to the input zero at (0,1). So maybe the rule: The 2's appear at positions offset by the coordinates of the zero that is \"closest\" to the non-zero pattern? Actually the 2's appear at positions where row mod3 = 0 and col mod3 = 1. That is the same as the coordinates of the zero at (0,1) in input. So the 2's correspond to the zero at (0,1). So the rule: For each zero cell that is not overlapped by a non-zero cell, we replicate 2 at positions where row mod N = i and col mod N = j? Wait that would produce 2's at positions where row mod3=0, col mod3=1. That matches. But we also had zeros at (0,0),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2) that did not produce 2's. So maybe we only replicate 2 for zeros that are \"adjacent\" to the non-zero cells? But (0,0) is not adjacent to any non-zero? Actually (0,0) is diagonally adjacent to (1,1)? But there is no non-zero at (1,1). So maybe we only replicate 2 for zeros that are \"adjacent\" to the pattern of non-zero cells in a certain shape? Let's examine.\n\nIn example 2, the 7's form a shape like:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 7\nRow2: 7 0 0\n\nSo the 7's are at positions (1,2) and (2,0). The zeros at (0,1) is the only zero that is adjacent to both 7's? Let's check adjacency: (0,1) is adjacent to (1,2) diagonally. It's also adjacent to (2,0) diagonally? Actually (0,1) to (2,0) is two steps away. So maybe not.\n\nLet's examine example 3: Non-zeros at (1,1) and (2,1). So 8's form a vertical line of two cells. The zeros at (0,0) and (1,0) produce 2's. These zeros are left of the vertical line: (0,0) is above left corner, (1,0) is left of the first 8. So maybe zeros that are in the same column as the leftmost non-zero? Actually the vertical line of 8's is at column 1. The zeros that produce 2's are at column 0. So maybe zeros that are in the column immediately left of the vertical line produce 2's. And also maybe zeros that are in the row immediately above the vertical line produce 2's? But (0,0) is above-left of the vertical line, while (1,0) is left of the vertical line. So both produce 2's. So maybe rule: For each zero that is adjacent to the cluster of non-zero cells (i.e., adjacent horizontally or vertically or diagonally?), we replicate 2 at positions where row mod N = i and col mod N = j. But not all zeros produce 2. Let's test this rule: In example 2, zeros at (0,1),(0,0),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2). Which of these are adjacent to the cluster of 7's? The cluster of 7's includes cells (1,2) and (2,0). Let's compute adjacency: For each zero, check if any neighbor (including diagonals) is a non-zero cell. Let's check:\n\n- (0,0): neighbors: (0,1),(1,0),(1,1). None are non-zero. So not adjacent.\n- (0,1): neighbors: (0,0),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2). (1,2) is non-zero. So adjacent.\n- (0,2): neighbors: (0,1),(1,1),(1,2). (1,2) is non-zero. So adjacent.\n- (1,0): neighbors: (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1). (2,0) is non-zero. So adjacent.\n- (1,1): neighbors: (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2). (1,2) and (2,0) are non-zero. So adjacent.\n- (2,1): neighbors: (1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,2). (2,0) is non-zero. So adjacent.\n- (2,2): neighbors: (1,1),(1,2),(2,1). (1,2) is non-zero. So adjacent.\n\nSo all zeros are adjacent to at least one non-zero cell. So that rule doesn't differentiate.\n\nLet's examine the pattern of zeros that produce 2's: (0,1) only. So maybe we need to consider zeros that are adjacent to the non-zero cells in a certain orientation (e.g., to the \"north-west\" direction?). Let's examine the coordinates relative to non-zero cells:\n\n- For zero at (0,1), relative to non-zero at (1,2): delta = (-1,-1). That's diagonally up-left relative to (1,2). Relative to non-zero at (2,0): delta = (-2,1). That's two steps up and one right. So not a simple direction.\n\n- For zero at (0,0), relative to (1,2): (-1,-2). Not simple.\n\n- For zero at (0,2), relative to (1,2): (-1,0). Up.\n\n- For zero at (1,0), relative to (2,0): (-1,0). Up.\n\n- For zero at (1,1), relative to (1,2): (0,-1). Left.\n\n- For zero at (2,1), relative to (2,0): (0,1). Right.\n\n- For zero at (2,2), relative to (1,2): (1,0). Down.\n\nSo zero at (0,1) is the only one that is diagonally up-left relative to one of the non-zeros. So maybe rule: For each zero that is diagonally adjacent to a non-zero cell, we replicate 2 at positions where row mod N = i, col mod N = j. But we need to check if this holds for other examples.\n\nExample 1: Non-zero at (1,1). Zeros diagonally adjacent: (0,0),(0,2),(2,0),(2,2). All four are diagonally adjacent. But only zero at (0,0) produced 2's. So rule fails.\n\nExample 3: Non-zeros at (1,1),(2,1). Zeros diagonally adjacent: Let's list zeros:\n\n- (0,0) relative to (1,1): (-1,-1) diagonal. Good.\n- (0,1) relative to (1,1): (-1,0) up. Not diagonal.\n- (0,2) relative to (1,1): (-1,1) up-right. Not diagonal.\n- (1,0) relative to (1,1): (0,-1) left. Not diagonal.\n- (1,2) relative to (1,1): (0,1) right. Not diagonal.\n- (2,0) relative to (2,1): (0,-1) left. Not diagonal.\n- (2,2) relative to (2,1): (0,1) right. Not diagonal.\n- (3,0) relative to (2,1): (1,-1) down-left. Not diagonal? Actually (3,0) relative to (2,1): (1,-1) diagonal. So zero at (3,0) is diagonally adjacent to (2,1). But (3,0) did not produce 2. So rule fails.\n\nSo diagonal adjacency alone is not enough.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern of 2's in each example more thoroughly. We need to find a rule that matches all examples.\n\nObservation: In each output, the non-zero cells (the same as input values) appear at positions where both coordinates are congruent to the input coordinates modulo N. That part seems consistent.\n\nAdditionally, there are 2's appearing at positions that form a pattern offset by some offset vector relative to the modulo grid. In each example, the 2's appear at positions where (row mod N, col mod N) equals some specific pair(s). For example:\n\n- Example 1: 2's appear at (0,0) only. So offset vector (0,0). Actually 2's appear at positions where row mod2=0, col mod2=0.\n\n- Example 2: 2's appear at (0,1) only. So offset vector (0,1).\n\n- Example 3: 2's appear at (0,0) and (1,0). So offset vectors (0,0) and (1,0).\n\n- Example 4: 2's appear at (0,1) and (2,0). So offset vectors (0,1) and (2,0).\n\nSo the set of offset vectors for 2's depends on the input pattern. It might be the set of coordinates of the zero cells that are \"in the same row or column\" as the non-zero cells? Let's examine.\n\nIn example 1: Input non-zero at (1,1). Zero at (0,0) is the only zero that is \"diagonally opposite\" to the non-zero cell. But (0,0) offset vector (0,0) relative to modulo grid? Wait (0,0) is a coordinate in the modulo grid. So 2's appear at offset vector (0,0). So maybe the rule: The set of offset vectors for 2's is the set of coordinates of the zero cells that are not part of the non-zero cluster? But we need to formalize.\n\nLet's examine each example in more detail, focusing on the positions of non-zero cells and the positions of 2's.\n\nExample 1: N=2. Input non-zero at (1,1). The set of non-zero coordinates: {(1,1)}. The set of zero coordinates: {(0,0),(0,1),(1,0)}. The set of 2's in output: positions where (row mod2, col mod2) in { (0,0) }. So offset set for 2's is {(0,0)}. That offset corresponds to the zero coordinate (0,0) in input. So the offset set equals the set of coordinates of zeros that are \"complementary\" to the non-zero? But there are three zeros; only one zero coordinate is in offset set. So maybe we only consider zeros that are \"corner\" cells? Let's examine.\n\nThe input grid is 2x2. The non-zero at (1,1) is bottom-right. The zero at (0,0) is top-left. The zeros at (0,1) and (1,0) are adjacent to the non-zero. So maybe we only consider zeros that are not adjacent to the non-zero? In 2x2 grid, the only zero not adjacent is (0,0) (diagonally opposite). So offset set = { (0,0) }. That matches.\n\nExample 2: N=3. Input non-zeros at (1,2),(2,0). Let's find zeros that are not adjacent to any non-zero? Let's compute adjacency again. We saw all zeros are adjacent to at least one non-zero. So there is no zero that is not adjacent. So that rule fails.\n\nMaybe we consider zeros that are \"adjacent\" to all non-zeros? Let's check.\n\n- Zero at (0,1): neighbors include (1,2) which is non-zero. But not all non-zeros? It doesn't neighbor (2,0). So not adjacent to all.\n\n- Zero at (0,0): neighbors include none. So not adjacent to any non-zero.\n\n- Zero at (0,2): neighbors include (1,2). Not all.\n\n- Zero at (1,0): neighbors include (2,0). Not all.\n\n- Zero at (1,1): neighbors include both (1,2) and (2,0). So zero at (1,1) is adjacent to both non-zeros. But zero at (1,1) did not produce 2's. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe we consider zeros that are \"between\" the non-zero cells in a straight line? Let's examine.\n\nIn example 2, non-zeros at (1,2) and (2,0). The vector difference between them is (1,-2). They are not in same row or column. So no straight line. So maybe not.\n\nLet's examine the pattern of 2's more. In example 2, 2's appear at positions where row mod3=0 and col mod3=1. That offset vector (0,1) corresponds to the input zero at (0,1). So maybe we consider zeros that are at the \"center\" of the grid? But (0,1) is not center; center of 3x3 is (1,1). So no.\n\nMaybe we consider zeros that are at the same row as the first non-zero cell? In example 2, first non-zero cell is (1,2). Same row is row1. Zeros at row1: (1,0),(1,1). But 2's appear at row0,3,6. So not.\n\nMaybe we consider zeros that are at the same column as the first non-zero cell? Non-zero at (1,2) column 2. Zeros at column2: (0,2),(2,2). 2's appear at col1,4,7. So not.\n\nMaybe we consider zeros that are at the \"top-left\" corner relative to the non-zero cells? In example 2, the top-left corner of the grid is (0,0). But 2's appear at (0,1). So not.\n\nMaybe we consider zeros that are at positions that are \"in the same diagonal\" as the non-zero cells? Let's check.\n\nIn example 2, non-zeros at (1,2) and (2,0). The diagonals: (1,2) is on the diagonal that goes from (0,1) to (2,3). (2,0) is on the diagonal that goes from (0,-2) to (4,2). The zero at (0,1) is on the same diagonal as (1,2). So maybe zeros that lie on the same diagonal as a non-zero produce 2's? But zero at (2,2) is on the same diagonal as (1,2)? Actually (2,2) is not on the diagonal of (1,2). (1,2) diagonal includes cells where row-col = -1? Actually (1,2) has row-col = -1. The diagonal includes (0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,4), etc. So zero at (0,1) is on that diagonal. Zero at (2,2) row-col = 0, not on that diagonal. Zero at (1,1) row-col = 0, not on that diagonal. So maybe only zero at (0,1) is on that diagonal. So 2's appear at that offset. But zero at (2,0) is on the diagonal of (1,2)? Actually (2,0) row-col = 2, not -1. So not.\n\nBut what about the other non-zero at (2,0)? Its diagonal includes cells where row+col = 2? Actually (2,0) has row+col=2. The diagonal includes (0,2),(1,1),(2,0),(3,-1)... So zero at (1,1) is on that diagonal. But 2's do not appear at offset (1,1). So not.\n\nThus not.\n\nMaybe the 2's appear at positions that correspond to zeros that are \"adjacent\" to exactly one non-zero cell? Let's test:\n\n- Zero at (0,1): adjacent to (1,2) only? Actually it's adjacent to (1,2) only. It is not adjacent to (2,0). So adjacent to exactly one non-zero. Zero at (0,0): adjacent to none. Zero at (0,2): adjacent to (1,2). So adjacent to exactly one. Zero at (1,0): adjacent to (2,0). So adjacent to exactly one. Zero at (1,1): adjacent to both. Zero at (2,1): adjacent to (2,0). Zero at (2,2): adjacent to (1,2). So all zeros are adjacent to at least one non-zero. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe we consider zeros that are adjacent to a non-zero cell in the direction that matches the offset of the 2's. For example, 2's offset (0,1) means row mod3=0, col mod3=1. That is a zero at (0,1). So maybe we consider zeros at (0,1) only. But we need a rule that picks that zero.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For each zero cell, we consider the vector from that zero to each non-zero cell. If that vector matches some pattern, then we replicate 2 at positions offset accordingly. But that's too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: The 2's appear at positions that are the same as the coordinates of the zero cells that are \"not part of the pattern of non-zero cells\" when you consider the shape of the non-zero cells. For example, in example 3, the non-zero cells form a vertical line at column 1. The zeros that produce 2's are at (0,0) and (1,0). These are the cells that are \"to the left\" of the vertical line. In example 4, the non-zero cells form a shape like an L: one at (1,2) and one at (3,1). The zeros that produce 2's are at (0,1) and (2,0). These are the cells that are \"to the left\" of the first non-zero (1,2) and \"above\" the second non-zero (3,1). Actually (0,1) is above (1,2) but not directly left. (2,0) is left of (3,1) but also below (1,2). So not.\n\nMaybe the 2's correspond to the \"missing\" positions that would make the non-zero cells form a certain shape like a diagonal or line of length 3? For example, in example 1, the non-zero cell at (1,1) alone. The 2's at (0,0) produce a diagonal line of 7's at (1,1) and 2's at (0,0). But the 2's are not 7's. So maybe they form a pattern of 2's that are in the same diagonal as the non-zero cells? Let's examine:\n\n- Example 1: Non-zero at (1,1). The diagonal with slope 1 (i.e., positions where row-col constant) includes cells (0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(5,5). The 2's appear at (0,0),(2,2),(4,4). The 7's appear at (1,1),(3,3),(5,5). So the pattern along that diagonal is alternating 2 and 7. So the 2's correspond to positions where the diagonal index is even? Actually (0,0) index 0 -> 2, (1,1) index 1 -> 7, (2,2) index 2 -> 2, (3,3) index 3 -> 7, etc. So yes, along the main diagonal, we alternate 2 and 7. The 2's appear at even indices along the diagonal.\n\n- Example 2: Non-zero at (1,2) and (2,0). Let's examine the diagonal patterns. The diagonal that goes through (1,2) and (2,3) etc. The 7's appear at positions where row mod3=1 and col mod3=2. That is the diagonal offset (1,2). The 2's appear at positions where row mod3=0 and col mod3=1. That is the diagonal offset (0,1). So along the diagonal with offset (0,1), we have 2's. So maybe the 2's correspond to the diagonal offset that is the \"difference\" between the two non-zero cells? Let's examine.\n\nIn example 2, the two non-zero cells at (1,2) and (2,0). The difference vector between them: (1,2) - (2,0) = (-1,2). The sum of them? Not. The offset (0,1) is not directly related to that difference.\n\nMaybe the 2's correspond to the diagonal offset that is one step \"before\" the non-zero offset along the main diagonal? For example, in example 1, the non-zero offset is (1,1). The 2 offset is (0,0), which is one step before along the diagonal. In example 2, the non-zero offsets are (1,2) and (2,0). The 2 offset is (0,1). That is not one step before either of them along the diagonal. But maybe we consider the \"midpoint\" of the two non-zero offsets? The two non-zero offsets (1,2) and (2,0). The average of their coordinates: ((1+2)/2,(2+0)/2) = (1.5,1). That's not an integer. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2's correspond to the offset that is the \"complement\" of the non-zero offset with respect to the grid dimension N? For example, for non-zero offset (i,j), the complement offset might be (i',j') such that (i + i') mod N = 0 and (j + j') mod N = 0? That would mean i' = (-i mod N), j' = (-j mod N). For example, in example 1, non-zero offset (1,1). Complement offset would be (-1 mod 2, -1 mod 2) = (1,1). That is the same as non-zero offset. So no.\n\nMaybe the 2's correspond to the offset that is the \"other\" coordinate that is not used by non-zero cells. For example, in example 2, non-zero offsets: (1,2) and (2,0). The set of all offsets (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2). The 2 offset (0,1) is not used by non-zero cells. But there are many unused offsets. So not.\n\nLet's examine the pattern of 2's relative to the pattern of 7's in example 1: 2's appear at (0,0),(2,2),(4,4). These are the positions where row=col and both even. The 7's appear at positions where row=col and both odd. So the 2's fill the even diagonal positions, while 7's fill the odd diagonal positions. So the pattern is a checkerboard along the diagonal. So the 2's are the \"other\" color along that diagonal.\n\nIn example 2, 7's appear at positions where row mod3=1, col mod3=2 (offset (1,2)). 2's appear at positions where row mod3=0, col mod3=1 (offset (0,1)). These two offsets are not on the same diagonal: offset (1,2) and (0,1) are offset by (1,1) difference. So they are adjacent along the diagonal direction? Actually difference (1,2)-(0,1) = (1,1). So they are offset by (1,1). So along the diagonal direction, they alternate: offset (0,1) (2), offset (1,2) (7). So maybe the pattern is along the diagonal direction: we alternate 2 and 7 along the diagonal offset (0,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,0) -> (0,1) etc. Let's check: The diagonal offset cycle of length 3: (0,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,0) -> (0,1). So indeed we have a cycle of length 3: offset (0,1) (2), offset (1,2) (7), offset (2,0) (7). Wait (2,0) also has 7? Actually 7's appear at offset (1,2) and (2,0). So 7's appear at two positions in that cycle. But we expected maybe 7's at one position. But we have 7's at two positions. So maybe the pattern is not alternating along the diagonal cycle.\n\nLet's examine the pattern of 2's and 7's in example 2: Offsets:\n\n- (0,1): 2\n- (1,2): 7\n- (2,0): 7\n\nSo we have 2 at offset (0,1), 7 at offsets (1,2) and (2,0). So 7's occupy two of the three offsets in the cycle. So maybe the 2's occupy the offset that is not occupied by a non-zero cell. But we have two non-zero cells, so there are two offsets with 7's. So the remaining offset (0,1) gets 2. That matches: 2 appears at offset that is not used by a non-zero cell. But there are many unused offsets, but we only see 2 at one of them. So maybe we only consider offsets that are \"adjacent\" to the non-zero offsets in some sense.\n\nLet's examine example 3: Offsets for 8's: (1,1) and (2,1). Offsets for 2's: (0,0) and (1,0). So 2's occupy offsets that are one step \"before\" each 8 offset along the column direction? Let's examine: For 8 at (1,1), offset (0,0) is one step up-left? Actually (0,0) relative to (1,1) is (-1,-1). For 8 at (2,1), offset (1,0) is one step up-left? Actually (1,0) relative to (2,1) is (-1,-1). So both 2 offsets are one step up-left relative to each 8 offset. So maybe the rule: For each non-zero cell at offset (i,j), we also place a 2 at offset (i-1 mod N, j-1 mod N). That would produce 2 at (0,0) for (1,1) (since (1-1,1-1)=(0,0)). And 2 at (1,0) for (2,1) (since (2-1,1-1)=(1,0)). That matches example 3.\n\nCheck example 1: Non-zero at (1,1). Then 2 at (1-1,1-1) = (0,0). That matches. Example 4: Non-zero at (1,2). Then 2 at (1-1,2-1) = (0,1). That matches. Non-zero at (3,1). Then 2 at (3-1,1-1) = (2,0). That matches. So the rule: For each non-zero input cell at (i,j), we also place a 2 at offset (i-1 mod N, j-1 mod N). That yields the set of 2 offsets. In example 2, we have two non-zero cells at (1,2) and (2,0). Then 2 offsets would be (1-1,2-1)=(0,1) and (2-1,0-1)=(1,-1 mod3=2). That would be (1,2). Wait (2-1=1, 0-1 mod3=2) -> (1,2). But (1,2) is an offset that is already used by a non-zero cell. But 2's appear at offset (0,1) only, not at (1,2). So that rule fails for example 2.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: For each non-zero input cell at (i,j), we place a 2 at offset (i-1 mod N, j-1 mod N) only if that offset is not already used by a non-zero cell? But in example 2, offset (1,2) is used by a non-zero cell. So we skip it. So we only place 2 at (0,1). That matches example 2.\n\nBut what about example 3: For non-zero at (1,1), offset (0,0) is not used by a non-zero cell. For non-zero at (2,1), offset (1,0) is not used by a non-zero cell. So we place 2 at both. That matches.\n\nExample 4: For non-zero at (1,2), offset (0,1) is not used by a non-zero cell. For non-zero at (3,1), offset (2,0) is not used by a non-zero cell. So we place 2 at both. That matches.\n\nExample 1: For non-zero at (1,1), offset (0,0) is not used by a non-zero cell. So we place 2 at (0,0). That matches.\n\nThus the rule seems to be: For each non-zero input cell at (i,j), we place a 2 at offset (i-1 mod N, j-1 mod N) if that offset is not already occupied by a non-zero cell. This yields the set of 2 offsets. Then we replicate the input pattern across the output grid: For each input cell at (i,j) with value v (non-zero or zero), we fill output cells at positions where row mod N = i and col mod N = j with value: if v != 0, then v; else if the offset (i,j) is in the set of 2 offsets, then 2; else 0.\n\nLet's test this rule on all examples.\n\nExample 1: N=2. Input non-zero at (1,1). Compute 2 offsets: (1-1,1-1) = (0,0). (0,0) not occupied by non-zero. So 2 offset set = {(0,0)}. Now fill output: For each input cell (i,j):\n- (0,0)=0. Since (0,0) is in 2 offset set, we set output cells at positions where row mod2=0, col mod2=0 to 2. That yields positions (0,0),(0,2),(0,4),(2,0),(2,2),(2,4),(4,0),(4,2),(4,4) as 2. Good.\n- (0,1)=0. (0,1) not in 2 offset set, so output cells at row mod2=0, col mod2=1 to 0. That yields positions (0,1),(0,3),(0,5),(2,1),(2,3),(2,5),(4,1),(4,3),(4,5) as 0. Good.\n- (1,0)=0. (1,0) not in 2 offset set, so output cells at row mod2=1, col mod2=0 to 0. Good.\n- (1,1)=7. (1,1) not in 2 offset set, so output cells at row mod2=1, col mod2=1 to 7. Good.\n\nMatches output.\n\nExample 2: N=3. Input non-zero at (1,2),(2,0). Compute 2 offsets: For (1,2): offset (1-1,2-1) = (0,1). For (2,0): offset (2-1,0-1 mod3=2) = (1,2). Now check if these offsets are occupied by non-zero cells: (0,1) is not a non-zero cell; (1,2) is a non-zero cell. So we include only (0,1). So 2 offset set = {(0,1)}. Now fill output: For each input cell:\n- (0,0)=0, not in 2 offset set, output cells at row mod3=0, col mod3=0 -> 0. Good.\n- (0,1)=0, in 2 offset set, output cells at row mod3=0, col mod3=1 -> 2. Good.\n- (0,2)=0, not in 2 offset set, output cells at row mod3=0, col mod3=2 -> 0. Good.\n- (1,0)=0, not in 2 offset set, output cells at row mod3=1, col mod3=0 -> 0. Good.\n- (1,1)=0, not in 2 offset set, output cells at row mod3=1, col mod3=1 -> 0. Good.\n- (1,2)=6, not in 2 offset set, output cells at row mod3=1, col mod3=2 -> 6. Good.\n- (2,0)=6, not in 2 offset set, output cells at row mod3=2, col mod3=0 -> 6. Good.\n- (2,1)=0, not in 2 offset set, output cells at row mod3=2, col mod3=1 -> 0. Good.\n- (2,2)=0, not in 2 offset set, output cells at row mod3=2, col mod3=2 -> 0. Good.\n\nThis matches output: 2's at row mod3=0, col mod3=1 positions, 6's at row mod3=1, col mod3=2 and row mod3=2, col mod3=0 positions. Yes.\n\nExample 3: N=5. Input non-zero at (1,1),(2,1). Compute 2 offsets:\n- For (1,1): offset (0,0). Not a non-zero cell. So include (0,0).\n- For (2,1): offset (1,0). Not a non-zero cell. So include (1,0).\nSo 2 offset set = {(0,0),(1,0)}. Now fill output: For each input cell:\n- (0,0)=0, not in 2 offset set -> 0 at row mod5=0, col mod5=0 -> 0. But output shows 2 at these positions. Wait we need to check: In example 3, output 2's appear at row mod5=0, col mod5=0 positions. But we predicted 0 because (0,0) is not in 2 offset set. But we included (0,0) as a 2 offset because we computed it from (1,1). Wait, we incorrectly used (0,0) as a 2 offset set. But (0,0) is the offset of a zero cell (input cell (0,0)). But we only include 2 offsets for each non-zero cell. So (0,0) is included as a 2 offset. So for input cell (0,0) (which is zero), we check if its offset (0,0) is in 2 offset set. Yes, it is. So we set output cells at row mod5=0, col mod5=0 to 2. That matches output. Good.\n\n- For input cell (0,1)=0, offset (0,1) not in 2 offset set, so output 0 at row mod5=0, col mod5=1. That matches output (0's at those positions). Good.\n\n- For input cell (0,2)=0, offset (0,2) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (0,3)=0, offset (0,3) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (0,4)=0, offset (0,4) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (1,0)=0, offset (1,0) is in 2 offset set, so output cells at row mod5=1, col mod5=0 -> 2. That matches output: row1 col0=2, row6 col0=2, row11 col0=2. Good.\n\n- For input cell (1,1)=8, offset (1,1) not in 2 offset set, so output cells at row mod5=1, col mod5=1 -> 8. That matches output: row1 col1=8, row6 col1=8, row11 col1=8. Good.\n\n- For input cell (1,2)=0, offset (1,2) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (1,3)=0, offset (1,3) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (1,4)=0, offset (1,4) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (2,0)=0, offset (2,0) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (2,1)=8, offset (2,1) not in 2 offset set -> 8. Good.\n\n- For input cell (2,2)=0, offset (2,2) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (2,3)=0, offset (2,3) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (2,4)=0, offset (2,4) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (3,0)=0, offset (3,0) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (3,1)=0, offset (3,1) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (3,2)=0, offset (3,2) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (3,3)=0, offset (3,3) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (3,4)=0, offset (3,4) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (4,0)=0, offset (4,0) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (4,1)=0, offset (4,1) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (4,2)=0, offset (4,2) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (4,3)=0, offset (4,3) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\n- For input cell (4,4)=0, offset (4,4) not in 2 offset set -> 0. Good.\n\nThus the rule matches all examples.\n\nNow let's test the rule on example 4:\n\nN=4. Input non-zero at (1,2),(3,1). Compute 2 offsets:\n- For (1,2): offset (0,1). Not a non-zero cell. So include (0,1).\n- For (3,1): offset (2,0). Not a non-zero cell. So include (2,0).\nSo 2 offset set = {(0,1),(2,0)}. Now fill output:\n- Input cell (0,0)=0, offset (0,0) not in 2 offset set -> output 0 at row mod4=0, col mod4=0. In output, row0 col0=0. Good.\n- Input cell (0,1)=0, offset (0,1) is in 2 offset set -> output 2 at row mod4=0, col mod4=1. In output, row0 col1=2. Good.\n- Input cell (0,2)=0, offset (0,2) not in 2 offset set -> output 0 at row mod4=0, col mod4=2. Output row0 col2=0. Good.\n- Input cell (0,3)=0, offset (0,3) not in 2 offset set -> output 0 at row mod4=0, col mod4=3. Output row0 col3=0. Good.\n\n- Input cell (1,0)=0, offset (1,0) not in 2 offset set -> output 0 at row mod4=1, col mod4=0. Output row1 col0=0. Good.\n\n- Input cell (1,1)=0, offset (1,1) not in 2 offset set -> output 0 at row mod4=1, col mod4=1. Output row1 col1=0. Good.\n\n- Input cell (1,2)=5, offset (1,2) not in 2 offset set -> output 5 at row mod4=1, col mod4=2. Output row1 col2=5. Good.\n\n- Input cell (1,3)=0, offset (1,3) not in 2 offset set -> output 0 at row mod4=1, col mod4=3. Output row1 col3=0. Good.\n\n- Input cell (2,0)=0, offset (2,0) is in 2 offset set -> output 2 at row mod4=2, col mod4=0. Output row2 col0=2. Good.\n\n- Input cell (2,1)=0, offset (2,1) not in 2 offset set -> output 0 at row mod4=2, col mod4=1. Output row2 col1=0. Good.\n\n- Input cell (2,2)=0, offset (2,2) not in 2 offset set -> output 0 at row mod4=2, col mod4=2. Output row2 col2=0. Good.\n\n- Input cell (2,3)=0, offset (2,3) not in 2 offset set -> output 0 at row mod4=2, col mod4=3. Output row2 col3=0. Good.\n\n- Input cell (3,0)=0, offset (3,0) not in 2 offset set -> output 0 at row mod4=3, col mod4=0. Output row3 col0=0. Good.\n\n- Input cell (3,1)=5, offset (3,1) not in 2 offset set -> output 5 at row mod4=3, col mod4=1. Output row3 col1=5. Good.\n\n- Input cell (3,2)=0, offset (3,2) not in 2 offset set -> output 0 at row mod4=3, col mod4=2. Output row3 col2=0. Good.\n\n- Input cell (3,3)=0, offset (3,3) not in 2 offset set -> output 0 at row mod4=3, col mod4=3. Output row3 col3=0. Good.\n\nThus the rule matches example 4.\n\nSo we have a consistent rule: For each non-zero input cell at (i,j) with value v, we replicate v at positions where row mod N = i and col mod N = j. Additionally, for each non-zero input cell at (i,j), we also create a 2 at positions where row mod N = (i-1 mod N) and col mod N = (j-1 mod N), unless that offset is already occupied by a non-zero input cell. Actually we only create 2 if that offset is not a non-zero cell. But we can also just compute the set of 2 offsets as the set of (i-1 mod N, j-1 mod N) for each non-zero cell, then remove any that coincide with a non-zero cell. Then for each input cell that is zero, we check if its offset is in the 2 offset set; if yes, we set output cells to 2; else 0.\n\nBut is this rule general? Let's test it on all examples thoroughly. We did above, it matches.\n\nNow we need to apply the rule to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0\n0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0\n\nSo N=4. Input grid 4x4. Non-zero cells: (1,2)=4, (3,0)=4. There are two 4's.\n\nCompute 2 offsets: For each non-zero cell at (i,j), compute (i-1 mod N, j-1 mod N). For (1,2): offset (0,1). For (3,0): offset (2,-1 mod4=3). Wait j-1 mod4: 0-1 mod4 = 3. So offset (2,3). Now check if these offsets are occupied by non-zero cells. Are there non-zero cells at (0,1) or (2,3)? No. So both offsets are valid. So 2 offset set = {(0,1),(2,3)}.\n\nNow we need to produce output grid of size 12x12 (3N). For each input cell (i,j) with value v, we fill output cells at positions where row mod N = i and col mod N = j with:\n\n- If v != 0: v.\n- Else if (i,j) in 2 offset set: 2.\n- Else: 0.\n\nThus we will produce a 12x12 grid.\n\nLet's compute systematically. We'll produce a 12x12 grid with rows 0-11 and columns 0-11.\n\nWe can break into 3x3 blocks of 4x4 each. Each 4x4 block corresponds to an input cell. But we need to fill each block with the same value: either the input cell's value or 0 or 2. Actually each block is a 4x4 block of the same value? Wait, let's check example 1: Input cell (0,0)=0 produced a block of 2's? Actually block at rows 0-2, cols 0-2 had 2's at some positions and 0 at others. So the block is not uniform. Wait, we need to examine carefully. The output pattern is not a block of uniform value; rather each block is a 4x4 block of the same value? Let's check example 4: Input cell (0,1)=0. The block at rows 0-3, cols 4-7? Actually we need to see if the block at (0,1) is uniform. In example 4 output, the block at rows 0-3, cols 4-7 (i.e., block corresponding to input cell (0,1)) has values:\n\nRows 0-3, cols 4-7:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0 0? Wait row0 col4=0, col5=2, col6=0, col7=0. Row1 col4=0, col5=0, col6=5, col7=0. Row2 col4=0, col5=0, col6=0, col7=0. Row3 col4=0, col5=5, col6=0, col7=0. That block is not uniform. So the block is not uniform. So we cannot just fill each block with a single value.\n\nActually the output pattern is a repetition of the entire input grid, but with 2's inserted at certain positions. Wait, let's examine the output pattern for example 4: The output grid is basically the input grid repeated 3 times in each dimension, but with 2's inserted at positions corresponding to the 2 offsets. Let's confirm.\n\nThe input grid:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 5 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 5 0 0\n\nNow the output grid 12x12 appears to be the input grid repeated 3 times horizontally and vertically, but with 2's inserted at positions that correspond to the 2 offsets.\n\nLet's check: The output grid is basically a 3x3 tiling of the 4x4 input grid, but with 2's added at certain positions. Let's test: In output, the block at rows 0-3, cols 0-3 is the input grid? Let's check row0-3, cols0-3:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0 0? Wait row0 col0=0, col1=2, col2=0, col3=0. So not exactly the input grid (which has row0: 0 0 0 0). So it's not a direct tiling. But maybe it's the input grid with 2's inserted at offset (0,1)? Let's check: In input grid, at (0,1)=0. In output, at positions where row mod4=0, col mod4=1, we have 2. So in block at rows 0-3, cols 0-3, we have 2 at col1. So that block has 2 at (0,1). In input, that position was 0. So it's modified.\n\nAlso at offset (2,3) we have 2. That appears at positions where row mod4=2, col mod4=3. So in block at rows 0-3, cols 0-3, we have 2 at (2,3). In input, at (2,3) was 0. So also modified.\n\nThus the output is basically the input grid repeated, but with 2's inserted at positions where row mod N = 0, col mod N = 1, and row mod N = 2, col mod N = 3. But the 2's appear across all blocks, not just the first block.\n\nThus we can compute the output by iterating over all positions (x,y) in the output grid of size 3N x 3N. Let i = x mod N, j = y mod N. Let v = input[i][j]. If v != 0: output[x][y] = v. Else: if (i,j) is in 2 offset set: output[x][y] = 2; else: output[x][y] = 0.\n\nThus the output is basically a 3x3 tiling of the input grid, but with 2's inserted at positions where the modulo coordinates match any of the 2 offsets.\n\nLet's test this rule on example 4: For each output cell (x,y), compute i=x mod4, j=y mod4. If input[i][j] != 0, output = input[i][j]. Else if (i,j) in 2 offset set {(0,1),(2,3)}, output=2 else 0. Let's test a few positions:\n\n- Output (0,0): i=0,j=0. input[0][0]=0. (0,0) not in 2 offset set. So output=0. Good.\n\n- Output (0,1): i=0,j=1. input[0][1]=0. (0,1) in 2 offset set. So output=2. Good.\n\n- Output (0,2): i=0,j=2. input[0][2]=0. (0,2) not in 2 offset set. So output=0. Good.\n\n- Output (0,3): i=0,j=3. input[0][3]=0. (0,3) not in 2 offset set. So output=0. Good.\n\n- Output (0,4): i=0,j=0. input[0][0]=0. (0,0) not in 2 offset set. So output=0. Good.\n\n- Output (0,5): i=0,j=1. input[0][1]=0. (0,1) in 2 offset set. So output=2. Good.\n\n- Output (0,6): i=0,j=2. input[0][2]=0. (0,2) not in 2 offset set. So output=0. Good.\n\n- Output (0,7): i=0,j=3. input[0][3]=0. (0,3) not in 2 offset set. So output=0. Good.\n\n- Output (0,8): i=0,j=0. output=0. Good.\n\n- Output (0,9): i=0,j=1. output=2. Good.\n\n- Output (0,10): i=0,j=2. output=0. Good.\n\n- Output (0,11): i=0,j=3. output=0. Good.\n\nMatches the first row of output example 4: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0. Yes.\n\nNow check output (1,2): i=1,j=2. input[1][2]=5. So output=5. Good. That matches row1 col2=5.\n\nCheck output (1,6): i=1,j=2. output=5. Good. That matches row1 col6=5.\n\nCheck output (1,10): i=1,j=2. output=5. Good.\n\nCheck output (2,0): i=2,j=0. input[2][0]=0. (2,0) not in 2 offset set. So output=0. Good.\n\nCheck output (2,3): i=2,j=3. input[2][3]=0. (2,3) in 2 offset set. So output=2. Good.\n\nCheck output (2,4): i=2,j=0. output=0. Good.\n\nCheck output (2,7): i=2,j=3. output=2. Good.\n\nCheck output (2,8): i=2,j=0. output=0. Good.\n\nCheck output (3,1): i=3,j=1. input[3][1]=5. output=5. Good.\n\nCheck output (3,5): i=3,j=1. output=5. Good.\n\nCheck output (3,9): i=3,j=1. output=5. Good.\n\nCheck output (4,0): i=0,j=0. output=0. Good.\n\nCheck output (4,1): i=0,j=1. output=2. Good.\n\nCheck output (4,2): i=0,j=2. output=0. Good.\n\nCheck output (4,3): i=0,j=3. output=0. Good.\n\nCheck output (4,4): i=0,j=0. output=0. Good.\n\nCheck output (4,5): i=0,j=1. output=2. Good.\n\nCheck output (4,6): i=0,j=2. output=0. Good.\n\nCheck output (4,7): i=0,j=3. output=0. Good.\n\nCheck output (4,8): i=0,j=0. output=0. Good.\n\nCheck output (4,9): i=0,j=1. output=2. Good.\n\nCheck output (4,10): i=0,j=2. output=0. Good.\n\nCheck output (4,11): i=0,j=3. output=0. Good.\n\nThus the rule holds for example 4.\n\nNow we can apply the same rule to the test input.\n\nTest input:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0\n0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0\n\nN=4. Input non-zero cells: (1,2)=4, (3,0)=4. Compute 2 offsets: For (1,2): offset (0,1). For (3,0): offset (2,-1 mod4=3) => (2,3). So 2 offset set = {(0,1),(2,3)}.\n\nThus the output grid of size 12x12 is defined by: For each output cell (x,y) with 0 <= x,y <= 11:\n- Let i = x mod 4, j = y mod 4.\n- Let v = input[i][j].\n- If v != 0: output[x][y] = v.\n- Else if (i,j) in {(0,1),(2,3)}: output[x][y] = 2.\n- Else: output[x][y] = 0.\n\nThus we can generate the grid.\n\nLet's produce the 12x12 grid. We'll produce rows 0 to 11, each row of 12 values.\n\nWe can compute each row by iterating columns 0-11.\n\nBut we can also produce a pattern by dividing the grid into 3x3 blocks of 4x4 each. Each block is a 4x4 subgrid corresponding to an input cell at position (i,j). But the output is not uniform across the block because of the 2's inserted at offset positions that are same for all blocks. But we can compute each row.\n\nLet's write the input grid as a 4x4 matrix:\n\nInput matrix (i,j):\ni=0: [0,0,0,0]\ni=1: [0,0,4,0]\ni=2: [0,0,0,0]\ni=3: [4,0,0,0]\n\nNow we need to produce output grid of size 12x12. For each output cell (x,y), compute i=x mod4, j=y mod4.\n\nWe can produce row by row:\n\nRow0: x=0 => i=0. So for each column y from 0 to 11, j=y mod4. So we need to produce values based on input[0][j] and 2 offset set.\n\nInput[0][0] = 0. (0,0) not in 2 offset set => output 0.\nInput[0][1] = 0. (0,1) in 2 offset set => output 2.\nInput[0][2] = 0. (0,2) not in 2 offset set => 0.\nInput[0][3] = 0. (0,3) not in 2 offset set => 0.\n\nSo for each block of 4 columns (col0-3, col4-7, col8-11), the pattern repeats: 0,2,0,0.\n\nThus Row0: [0,2,0,0, 0,2,0,0, 0,2,0,0].\n\nRow1: x=1 => i=1. Input[1][0] = 0. (1,0) not in 2 offset set => 0.\nInput[1][1] = 0. (1,1) not in 2 offset set => 0.\nInput[1][2] = 4. (1,2) not in 2 offset set => 4.\nInput[1][3] = 0. (1,3) not in 2 offset set => 0.\n\nThus Row1: [0,0,4,0, 0,0,4,0, 0,0,4,0].\n\nRow2: x=2 => i=2. Input[2][0] = 0. (2,0) not in 2 offset set => 0.\nInput[2][1] = 0. (2,1) not in 2 offset set => 0.\nInput[2][2] = 0. (2,2) not in 2 offset set => 0.\nInput[2][3] = 0. (2,3) in 2 offset set => 2.\n\nThus Row2: [0,0,0,2, 0,0,0,2, 0,0,0,2].\n\nRow3: x=3 => i=3. Input[3][0] = 4. (3,0) not in 2 offset set => 4.\nInput[3][1] = 0. (3,1) not in 2 offset set => 0.\nInput[3][2] = 0. (3,2) not in 2 offset set => 0.\nInput[3][3] = 0. (3,3) not in 2 offset set => 0.\n\nThus Row3: [4,0,0,0, 4,0,0,0, 4,0,0,0].\n\nRow4: x=4 => i=0 again. So same as Row0: [0,2,0,0, 0,2,0,0, 0,2,0,0].\n\nRow5: x=5 => i=1. Same as Row1: [0,0,4,0, 0,0,4,0, 0,0,4,0].\n\nRow6: x=6 => i=2. Same as Row2: [0,0,0,2, 0,0,0,2, 0,0,0,2].\n\nRow7: x=7 => i=3. Same as Row3: [4,0,0,0, 4,0,0,0, 4,0,0,0].\n\nRow8: x=8 => i=0. Same as Row0: [0,2,0,0, 0,2,0,0, 0,2,0,0].\n\nRow9: x=9 => i=1. Same as Row1: [0,0,4,0, 0,0,4,0, 0,0,4,0].\n\nRow10: x=10 => i=2. Same as Row2: [0,0,0,2, 0,0,0,2, 0,0,0,2].\n\nRow11: x=11 => i=3. Same as Row3: [4,0,0,0, 4,0,0,0, 4,0,0,0].\n\nThus the output grid is:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2\nRow3: 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2\nRow7: 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\nRow8: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow9: 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0\nRow10: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2\nRow11: 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n\nBut we need to check if there are any other 2 offsets? We computed 2 offset set = {(0,1),(2,3)}. That seems correct.\n\nNow let's check the output pattern of example 4: It had 2's at positions where row mod4=0, col mod4=1 and row mod4=2, col mod4=0? Wait example 4 had 2 offsets {(0,1),(2,0)}. Actually example 4 had 2 offsets (0,1),(2,0). Let's double-check example 4 output to confirm that pattern: In example 4 output, 2's appear at positions where row mod4=0, col mod4=1 (true). And also at positions where row mod4=2, col mod4=0 (true). So 2 offsets were (0,1),(2,0). Yes. So for test input, 2 offsets are (0,1),(2,3). So we expect 2's at positions where row mod4=0, col mod4=1 and row mod4=2, col mod4=3. That matches our computed output: we have 2's at row0 col1, row0 col5, row0 col9; row2 col3, row2 col7, row2 col11; row4 col1, row4 col5, row4 col9; row6 col3, row6 col7, row6 col11; row8 col1, row8 col5, row8 col9; row10 col3, row10 col7, row10 col11. Yes.\n\nAlso we need to check if we should also include 2's at positions where row mod4=2, col mod4=3? Wait we already did that. Good.\n\nNow we need to verify that we didn't miss any 2's. Let's check each row:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0. Yes.\n\nRow1: 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0. Yes.\n\nRow2: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2. Yes.\n\nRow3: 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0. Yes.\n\nRow4: same as row0.\n\nRow5: same as row1.\n\nRow6: same as row2.\n\nRow7: same as row3.\n\nRow8: same as row0.\n\nRow9: same as row1.\n\nRow10: same as row2.\n\nRow11: same as row3.\n\nThus the output grid is as above.\n\nBut we need to double-check that the rule indeed uses (i-1 mod N, j-1 mod N) for each non-zero cell. For (1,2) and (3,0), we computed (0,1) and (2,3). That's correct. Now we need to ensure that we didn't need to check if these offsets are not occupied by non-zero cells. But they are not. So we include both.\n\nThus the final output grid is as we computed.\n\nNow let's double-check with the pattern of the input: The input grid has 4's at (1,2) and (3,0). The output grid should have 4's at positions where row mod4=1, col mod4=2 (i.e., (1,2),(1,6),(1,10),(5,2),(5,6),(5,10),(9,2),(9,6),(9,10)). And also at positions where row mod4=3, col mod4=0 (i.e., (3,0),(3,4),(3,8),(7,0),(7,4),(7,8),(11,0),(11,4),(11,8)). Let's check:\n\n- Row1: col2=4, col6=4, col10=4. Good.\n- Row5: col2=4, col6=4, col10=4. Good.\n- Row9: col2=4, col6=4, col10=4. Good.\n\n- Row3: col0=4, col4=4, col8=4. Good.\n- Row7: col0=4, col4=4, col8=4. Good.\n- Row11: col0=4, col4=4, col8=4. Good.\n\nSo 4's appear as expected.\n\nNow the 2's appear at positions where row mod4=0, col mod4=1: (0,1),(0,5),(0,9),(4,1),(4,5),(4,9),(8,1),(8,5),(8,9). And also at positions where row mod4=2, col mod4=3: (2,3),(2,7),(2,11),(6,3),(6,7),(6,11),(10,3),(10,7),(10,11). Let's check our output:\n\n- Row0: col1=2, col5=2, col9=2. Good.\n- Row4: col1=2, col5=2, col9=2. Good.\n- Row8: col1=2, col5=2, col9=2. Good.\n\n- Row2: col3=2, col7=2, col11=2. Good.\n- Row6: col3=2, col7=2, col11=2. Good.\n- Row10: col3=2, col7=2, col11=2. Good.\n\nThus the pattern matches.\n\nNow we should also check if there are any other 2's. In our output, we only have 2's at these positions. That matches the rule.\n\nNow let's verify that there are no 2's at positions where row mod4=0, col mod4=3 or row mod4=2, col mod4=1, etc. In our output, those positions are 0. Good.\n\nNow we should produce the final output grid in the same format as the examples: each row separated by newline, values separated by spaces.\n\nThus final answer:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2\nRow3: 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2\nRow7: 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\nRow8: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow9: 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0\nRow10: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2\nRow11: 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n\nLet's check if any of the rows contain extra spaces or missing numbers. Each row should have 12 numbers. Let's count:\n\nRow0: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 => 12 numbers. Good.\n\nRow1: 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 => 12 numbers. Good.\n\nRow2: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 => 12 numbers. Good.\n\nRow3: 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 => 12 numbers. Good.\n\nRow4: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 => 12 numbers. Good.\n\nRow5: 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 => 12 numbers. Good.\n\nRow6: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 => 12 numbers. Good.\n\nRow7: 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 => 12 numbers. Good.\n\nRow8: 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 => 12 numbers. Good.\n\nRow9: 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 => 12 numbers. Good.\n\nRow10: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 => 12 numbers. Good.\n\nRow11: 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 => 12 numbers. Good.\n\nThus final output is correct.\n\nNow let's reflect on the rule: For each input cell with non-zero value v, we replicate v at positions where row mod N = i and col mod N = j. For each non-zero input cell, we also create a 2 at positions where row mod N = (i-1 mod N) and col mod N = (j-1 mod N), unless that offset is already occupied by a non-zero input cell. That seems to be the transformation.\n\nBut we should check if there are any cases where the 2 offset might coincide with a non-zero input cell, but we still want to place 2? For example, if we had a non-zero at (0,0) and (1,1) in a 2x2 grid, then the 2 offset for (1,1) would be (0,0) which is occupied by a non-zero. So we would not place a 2 at (0,0). But if we had a non-zero at (0,0) and (1,1), maybe we would not place any 2's? Let's test that hypothetical scenario: Input 2x2 with non-zero at (0,0) and (1,1). Then 2 offset for (0,0) is (-1 mod2=1, -1 mod2=1) => (1,1) which is occupied by a non-zero. So we skip. 2 offset for (1,1) is (0,0) which is occupied by a non-zero. So skip. So no 2's. So output would be just the replication of non-zeros. That seems plausible.\n\nNow we should test if the rule also covers the scenario where the 2 offset set might contain duplicates (two non-zero cells might produce the same offset). But that would be if two non-zero cells have offsets that coincide. That could happen if two non-zero cells are at positions that differ by (1,1) mod N. For example, if we had input non-zero at (0,1) and (1,2) in a 3x3 grid. Then offset for (0,1) is (-1 mod3=2,0) => (2,0). Offset for (1,2) is (0,1) => (0,1). So no duplicates. But if we had input non-zero at (0,1) and (1,2) in a 2x2 grid? Actually 2x2 only has 4 cells. So not.\n\nBut duplicates might occur if two non-zero cells have offsets that coincide, e.g., (i,j) and (i+1 mod N, j+1 mod N) produce same offset? Actually offset for (i,j) is (i-1 mod N, j-1 mod N). For two different cells (i1,j1) and (i2,j2) to produce same offset, we need (i1-1 mod N, j1-1 mod N) = (i2-1 mod N, j2-1 mod N). That implies i1 mod N = i2 mod N and j1 mod N = j2 mod N. So they would be the same cell. So duplicates cannot happen. So each non-zero cell yields a unique offset. So the 2 offset set is just the set of those offsets that are not occupied by non-zero cells.\n\nThus the rule is consistent.\n\nNow let's produce the final answer.\n\nBut before finalizing, let's double-check the test input to ensure we didn't misread the input. The test input:\n\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0\n0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0\n\nYes. So input grid:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 4 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 4 0 0 0\n\nThus non-zero cells: (1,2) and (3,0). Yes.\n\nNow compute 2 offsets: (1-1,2-1) = (0,1). (3-1,0-1) = (2,3). Good.\n\nNow produce output grid as we did.\n\nLet's just double-check that the output grid matches the pattern of example 4: In example 4, the input grid had non-zero cells at (1,2),(3,1). The 2 offsets were (0,1),(2,0). The output grid had 5's at positions where row mod4=1, col mod4=2 and row mod4=3, col mod4=1. And 2's at positions where row mod4=0, col mod4=1 and row mod4=2, col mod4=0. That matches our pattern.\n\nThus for test input, the 4's appear at positions where row mod4=1, col mod4=2 and row mod4=3, col mod4=0. The 2's appear at positions where row mod4=0, col mod4=1 and row mod4=2, col mod4=3. That is consistent.\n\nThus final output grid is as we computed.\n\nNow let's double-check the output grid for any potential mistakes: The output grid we produced has 4's at the correct positions, 2's at the correct positions, and zeros elsewhere.\n\nWe can also cross-check by generating the output using the rule described programmatically, but we can't run code here. But we can manually verify a few positions.\n\nLet's verify row3 col4: row3 col4 is output[3][4] = 4? Wait row3 col4 is part of the second block: row3 col4 corresponds to i=3 mod4=3, j=4 mod4=0. Input[3][0] = 4. So output should be 4. Yes, row3 col4=4.\n\nCheck row3 col8: row3 col8 corresponds to i=3, j=8 mod4=0. Input[3][0] = 4. So output=4. Yes, row3 col8=4.\n\nCheck row7 col8: row7 col8 corresponds to i=3, j=8 mod4=0. Input[3][0] = 4. So output=4. Yes, row7 col8=4.\n\nCheck row11 col8: row11 col8 corresponds to i=3, j=8 mod4=0. Input[3][0] = 4. So output=4. Yes, row11 col8=4.\n\nCheck row1 col10: row1 col10 corresponds to i=1, j=10 mod4=2. Input[1][2] = 4. So output=4. Yes.\n\nCheck row5 col6: row5 col6 corresponds to i=1, j=6 mod4=2. Input[1][2] = 4. So output=4. Yes.\n\nCheck row9 col10: row9 col10 corresponds to i=1, j=10 mod4=2. Input[1][2] = 4. So output=4. Yes.\n\nCheck row2 col3: row2 col3 corresponds to i=2, j=3 mod4=3. Input[2][3] = 0. (2,3) is in 2 offset set, so output=2. Yes.\n\nCheck row6 col7: row6 col7 corresponds to i=2, j=7 mod4=3. Input[2][3] = 0. (2,3) is in 2 offset set, so output=2. Yes.\n\nCheck row10 col11: row10 col11 corresponds to i=2, j=11 mod4=3. Input[2][3] = 0. (2,3) is in 2 offset set, so output=2. Yes.\n\nCheck row0 col5: row0 col5 corresponds to i=0, j=5 mod4=1. Input[0][1] = 0. (0,1) is in 2 offset set, so output=2. Yes.\n\nCheck row4 col9: row4 col9 corresponds to i=0, j=9 mod4=1. Input[0][1] = 0. (0,1) in 2 offset",
    "4": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to find the rule mapping input to output. Let's analyze each example. Understand patterns: The inputs are 10x10 grids of integers. The outputs are modifications: some patterns extended or filled. The rule might involve replicating a vertical or horizontal stripe, or filling in missing parts.\n\nLet's analyze each example in detail.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\nRows:\n0: all 0\n1: all 0\n2: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5: 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0\n6-9: all 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 2: 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0\nRow 3: same\nRow 4: same\nRow 5: same\nThus, the vertical line of 5's at column 2 (index 2) from row 2 to 5 (vertical stripe). In output, the 5 remains at column 2, but the area to its right (columns 3-5?) is filled with 6's, and area to right of that with 9's. Wait, let's see: In input row 5: 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So there is already 6's and 9's to the right. In output, rows 2-4 have these 6's and 9's too. So the rule: replicate the pattern of the bottom row horizontally upwards until it reaches the topmost 5? Actually, the bottom row row 5 has 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. The rows above had only 5 at column 2. In output, those rows are filled with the same pattern: 5,6,6,6,9,9,9. So the rule might be: copy the pattern of the last row containing non-zero values horizontally to all rows above until the topmost row with 5? Wait, let's analyze.\n\nInput: vertical column of 5's from row 2 to 5. In row 5, there are also 6's and 9's. In output, rows 2-4 (above row 5) are filled with that pattern. So the pattern of the last row containing 6 and 9 is propagated upwards.\n\nIn example 2:\n\nInput: 5's column at column 0 from row 1 to 7. Then at row 7: 5 4 3 3 4 4 4 0 0 0\nRow 8: 5 7 3 7 7 3 3 0 0 0\nSo there are two rows at bottom: row 7 and row 8. They contain patterns with 5 at column 0, then other numbers. In output, rows 1-8 (except 0 and 9) are filled with a repeating pattern that cycles between row 7 and row 8? Let's check.\n\nOutput rows:\nRow 1: 5 4 3 3 4 4 4 0 0 0  (same as input row 7)\nRow 2: 5 7 3 7 7 3 3 0 0 0  (same as input row 8)\nRow 3: 5 4 3 3 4 4 4 0 0 0  (same as input row 7)\nRow 4: 5 7 3 7 7 3 3 0 0 0\nRow 5: 5 4 3 3 4 4 4 0 0 0\nRow 6: 5 7 3 7 7 3 3 0 0 0\nRow 7: 5 4 3 3 4 4 4 0 0 0\nRow 8: 5 7 3 7 7 3 3 0 0 0\n\nSo rows 1-8 are filled with alternating pattern of row 7 and row 8 from input. So the rule: replicate the pattern of the two rows at the bottom (or the pattern of the last two rows) upward, alternating between them, filling all rows between the first 5 column and the bottom? Actually, there is a vertical column of 5's at column 0 from rows 1 to 7. The pattern of rows 7 and 8 is repeated upward. The vertical column of 5's remains. So rule: take the last two rows that contain non-zero values (other than the 5 column?), and propagate them upward alternating.\n\nBut let's analyze example 3:\n\nInput: Row 1: 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRows 0,8,9: all 0\n\nOutput: Row 1 unchanged. Row 2: 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 (the 2's fill columns 1-6). Row 3: 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. Row 4: 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Row 5: 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0. Row 6: 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. Row 7: 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nSo the pattern: For each row that has a non-zero number in column 1 (except row 1 which has 5's), the number from that column (like 2,1,2,6,1,1) is extended horizontally across columns 1-6. So basically the column 1 values propagate horizontally across the same row, filling the region that originally had 5's in row 1. But the 5's remain unchanged. So the rule: fill the rectangle defined by the 5's (row 1 columns 1-6) with the values from column 1 for each row, copying horizontally.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: Row 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\nRow 1: 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 2: 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 3: 5 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\nRow 4: 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 5: 5 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\nRow 6: 5 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\nRow 7: 5 6 3 6 3 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 5 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: all 0\n\nOutput: Row 0 unchanged. Row 1: 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3\nRow 2: 5 2 2 2 2 0 3 3 3 3\nRow 3: 5 6 3 6 3 0 7 7 7 7\nRow 4: 5 2 2 2 2 0 3 3 3 3\nRow 5: 5 6 3 6 3 0 7 7 7 7\nRow 6: 5 2 2 2 2 0 7 7 7 7\nRow 7: 5 6 3 6 3 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 5 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations: There is a vertical column of 5's at column 0 from row 0 to 8. There is a horizontal row of 5's at row 0 columns 6-9. In input, columns 6-9 have 5's only at row 0. In output, those columns 6-9 are filled with patterns that depend on other rows: For each row, we look at the left side values (columns 1-4?) Actually columns 1-4 have values: row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. Wait, row 1 has 5 at col 0, then zeros until col 6 where 3 is. Row 1: 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. Row 2: same. Row 3: 5 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. Row 4: 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. Row 5: 5 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. Row 6: 5 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. Row 7: 5 6 3 6 3 0 0 0 0 0. Row 8: 5 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nIn output, columns 6-9 are filled with patterns from columns 1-4? Let's examine row 1 output: 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So columns 1-4 are 6 3 6 3? Wait, row 1 output: 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. That means columns 1-4: 6,3,6,3. But input row 1 had 0,0,0,0. So the left side values (columns 1-4) are not from input row 1. They are from row 7 or 8? Let's check: row 7 input: 5 6 3 6 3 0 0 0 0 0. So row 7 has 6 3 6 3 at columns 1-4. Row 8 input: 5 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So row 8 has 2 2 2 2 at columns 1-4. In output, row 1 has 6 3 6 3 at columns 1-4. So it used the pattern from row 7. Row 2 output: 5 2 2 2 2 0 3 3 3 3. So row 2 uses pattern from row 8. Row 3 output: 5 6 3 6 3 0 7 7 7 7. So row 3 uses pattern from row 7. Row 4 output: 5 2 2 2 2 0 3 3 3 3 (from row 8). Row 5: 5 6 3 6 3 0 7 7 7 7 (from row 7). Row 6: 5 2 2 2 2 0 7 7 7 7 (from row 8). Row 7 and 8 unchanged.\n\nSo the rule: The left side patterns (columns 1-4) for rows 1-6 are taken from rows 7 and 8 alternately. Meanwhile, columns 6-9 are filled with the right side values from rows 7 and 8? Wait, columns 6-9: Row 1 output: 3 3 3 3. Row 2 output: 3 3 3 3. Row 3 output: 7 7 7 7. Row 4 output: 3 3 3 3. Row 5 output: 7 7 7 7. Row 6 output: 7 7 7 7. So columns 6-9 are filled with the values from column 6 of rows 7 and 8? Input row 7: column 6 is 0. Input row 8: column 6 is 0. But we see 3 and 7. So the values come from column 6 of rows 1-6? Wait, input row 1 had 3 at column 6. Input row 2 had 3 at column 6. Input row 3 had 7 at column 6. Input row 4 had 3 at column 6. Input row 5 had 7 at column 6. Input row 6 had 7 at column 6. So columns 6-9 values come from column 6 of rows 1-6. But in output, they are extended horizontally across columns 6-9. So the pattern is: For each row, the value at column 6 (if non-zero) is repeated horizontally across columns 6-9. And the values at columns 1-4 are taken from rows 7 or 8 alternating. Actually, for rows 1-6, the left side values come from rows 7 or 8, while the right side values come from the row itself.\n\nBut why row 7 and 8 patterns alternate? Let's check: Row 1 uses row 7 pattern; row 2 uses row 8; row 3 uses row 7; row 4 uses row 8; row 5 uses row 7; row 6 uses row 8. So they alternate. So maybe the rule is: For each row above the two bottom rows, fill with the pattern of the bottom two rows alternating. But here we have more than two bottom rows: row 7 and 8. But we also have row 9? Row 9 is all zeros. So bottom rows with non-zero values are row 7 and 8. So we propagate patterns from those two rows upward. For rows 1-6, we alternate between row 7 and 8. But we also need to fill columns 6-9 with the value from column 6 of each row? Wait, in the output, columns 6-9 are filled with the value from column 6 of each row, but that is also repeated horizontally. That matches the pattern of example 3: For each row, the value at column 1 is repeated horizontally across columns 1-6. In example 4, the value at column 6 is repeated horizontally across columns 6-9. But the left side values (columns 1-4) are not repeated horizontally; they come from the pattern of rows 7 or 8. But maybe the rule is: For each row, we have a region of zeros to fill. That region is defined by the vertical stripe of 5's and the horizontal stripe of 5's. The region to fill is the rectangle defined by the intersection of the vertical stripe and the horizontal stripe. Then we fill that rectangle with patterns from the rows above or below.\n\nLet's analyze more systematically.\n\nWe need to deduce a general rule that applies to all four training examples. The test input is similar shape.\n\nFirst, examine the structure of each example.\n\nExample 1:\n\n- There is a vertical line of 5's at column 2 from row 2 to 5.\n- There is a horizontal line of 5's? Actually, no horizontal line of 5's. But there is a horizontal line of 6's and 9's at row 5: 5 6 6 6 9 9 9. So the region to fill is the rectangle below the vertical line? Actually, the rectangle is from row 2 to 4, columns 3-5? Wait, the output shows that rows 2-4, columns 3-5 are filled with 6's, and columns 6-8 are filled with 9's. So the rectangle is from row 2-4, columns 3-8. That rectangle is exactly the area to the right of the vertical stripe of 5's and below the horizontal stripe of 6/9? Actually, the horizontal stripe of 6/9 is only at row 5. But the output extends the pattern of row 5 upward to rows 2-4. So the rectangle is the area that is below the 5 column and above the bottom row? Wait, let's think.\n\nIn example 1, the vertical stripe of 5's goes from row 2 to 5. At row 5, there is a pattern of 6's and 9's. In output, rows 2-4 (above row 5) are filled with that pattern. So the rule: propagate the pattern from the bottommost row containing 6 and 9 upward to all rows above it until the top of the vertical stripe? But the vertical stripe stops at row 5. But we propagate upward until row 2? Actually, we propagate until the topmost row that has 5? In example 1, the vertical stripe of 5's starts at row 2. So we propagate pattern from row 5 to rows 2-4. That matches.\n\nExample 2:\n\n- Vertical stripe of 5's at column 0 from rows 1-7.\n- At row 7: 5 4 3 3 4 4 4\n- At row 8: 5 7 3 7 7 3 3\n- Output: rows 1-8 are filled with alternating patterns of row 7 and row 8. So we propagate patterns from rows 7 and 8 upward until row 1. So the rule: propagate the patterns from the two bottom rows upward alternating.\n\nExample 3:\n\n- Horizontal stripe of 5's at row 1 columns 1-6.\n- Column 1 has values 2,1,2,6,1,1 at rows 2-7.\n- Output: For each row, the value at column 1 is repeated horizontally across columns 1-6. So we propagate the value from column 1 horizontally across the horizontal stripe. So the rule: propagate the pattern from the column into the horizontal stripe.\n\nExample 4:\n\n- Horizontal stripe of 5's at row 0 columns 6-9.\n- Vertical stripe of 5's at column 0 rows 0-8.\n- There are patterns at rows 7 and 8 (with values 6 3 6 3 and 2 2 2 2).\n- The output: For rows 1-6, the left side (columns 1-4) are taken from rows 7 and 8 alternating. The right side (columns 6-9) are taken from the same row's column 6 value repeated horizontally.\n\nWait, but in example 4, the left side values of rows 1-6 are not from the row itself. They are from rows 7 and 8. So why? Because there is no pattern in columns 1-4 for rows 1-6; they are all zeros. But we have patterns at rows 7 and 8. So we propagate patterns from rows 7 and 8 upward. But we also propagate the pattern from the row's own column 6 to the right side. So the rule might be: For each row, we fill the rectangle that is to the right of the vertical stripe of 5's and below the horizontal stripe of 5's. The rectangle's left side (columns 1-4) is filled with patterns from the bottom rows (rows 7 and 8) alternating. The rectangle's right side (columns 6-9) is filled with the value from column 6 of that row repeated horizontally.\n\nBut why is the left side filled with patterns from rows 7 and 8? Because the left side (columns 1-4) are part of the rectangle defined by the vertical stripe of 5's (col 0) and the horizontal stripe of 5's (row 0). The rectangle is from row 1 to 8, columns 1-9. But within that rectangle, there is a vertical stripe of 5's at column 0, and a horizontal stripe of 5's at row 0. So the rectangle is everything else. For rows 1-6, the left side (columns 1-4) is currently zeros. But there are patterns at rows 7 and 8 that we can propagate upward. So the rule: propagate patterns from the bottommost rows upward into the rectangle. But why alternate? Because there are two distinct patterns at rows 7 and 8. They alternate to fill the rows above. So the pattern for rows 1-6 is: row 1 gets pattern from row 7, row 2 gets pattern from row 8, row 3 gets pattern from row 7, etc.\n\nSimilarly, for the right side (columns 6-9), the values come from the row itself. Because the row has a value at column 6 (3 or 7). That is repeated horizontally across columns 6-9. So the rule: fill the right side of the rectangle with the row's own column 6 value repeated horizontally. The left side of the rectangle is filled with patterns from the bottom rows.\n\nLet's analyze the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 2: 4 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 3: 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 4: 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 5: 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 6: 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 8 6 8\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 3\nRow 9: all zeros\n\nWe need to produce an output grid.\n\nObservations: There is a vertical stripe of 5's at column 0 from rows 1-6. Actually, check: Row 1 has 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0. So row 1 has 5 at columns 0-4 and also 5 at column 6. So there is a vertical stripe at column 0 from row 1 to row 6. There is also a vertical stripe at column 6 from row 1 to row 8 (since row 7,8 also have 5 at column 6). Actually, row 7 has 5 at column 6. Row 8 also has 5 at column 6. So there is a vertical stripe at column 6 from row 1 to 8. So we have two vertical stripes of 5's: one at column 0 (rows 1-6) and one at column 6 (rows 1-8). Also, row 1 has 5's at columns 0-4 and column 6. So there is a horizontal stripe of 5's at row 1 columns 0-4. Also, maybe there's a horizontal stripe at row 1 columns 6? Actually, row 1 has 5 at column 6 but not at columns 7-9. So there's a horizontal stripe at row 1 columns 0-4, and maybe a vertical stripe at column 6. There's also a horizontal stripe at row 1 columns 0-4. Row 1 also has a 5 at column 6, but no continuous stripe there.\n\nAlso, row 7 and row 8 have patterns at columns 6-9: row 7: 5 8 6 8 (positions 6-9). Row 8: 5 3 3 3 (positions 6-9). So there are patterns at rows 7 and 8, similar to examples 2 and 4.\n\nWe need to deduce the rule. The training examples show patterns with vertical stripes of 5's and horizontal stripes of 5's. The output often propagates patterns from the bottom rows upward into the rectangle defined by the intersection of the stripes. Let's analyze each example in terms of the rectangle defined by the stripes.\n\nDefine stripes: In each input, there is a vertical stripe of 5's that extends downwards from the top. There is also a horizontal stripe of 5's that extends rightwards from the leftmost 5. These stripes meet at the intersection point. The rectangle defined by the intersection of the stripes (i.e., the area below the horizontal stripe and to the right of the vertical stripe) is the region that is to be filled or modified.\n\nExample 1: There is a vertical stripe of 5's at column 2 from rows 2-5. There is no horizontal stripe of 5's? Actually, there is no horizontal stripe of 5's. Wait, the input row 5 has 5 at column 2, but also 6 and 9. So the horizontal stripe is only at row 5, but only at column 2. So the rectangle below the horizontal stripe is empty? Actually, there is no horizontal stripe to define a rectangle. But the output shows that the area below the vertical stripe (rows 2-4) is filled with the pattern from the bottom row. So maybe the rectangle is defined by the vertical stripe alone. The region below the vertical stripe is the rectangle. So the rule: propagate the pattern from the bottom row upward within the rectangle defined by the vertical stripe.\n\nExample 2: Vertical stripe at column 0 from rows 1-7. Horizontal stripe at row 7 columns 0-6? Actually, row 7 has 5 at column 0 and then values 4 3 3 4 4 4. So the horizontal stripe extends from column 0 to 6. So the rectangle below the horizontal stripe is rows 8-? Actually, the horizontal stripe is at row 7, but there is no rectangle below it because the grid ends at row 9. But the rectangle to the right of the vertical stripe is rows 1-7, columns 1-? Actually, the rectangle defined by the vertical stripe and horizontal stripe is the area to the right of the vertical stripe (columns 1-6) and below the horizontal stripe? Wait, the horizontal stripe is at row 7, so the area below it is rows 8-9. But the rectangle defined by the intersection of the vertical stripe and horizontal stripe is the area to the right of the vertical stripe (columns 1-6) and above the horizontal stripe (rows 1-6). That rectangle is rows 1-6, columns 1-6. That rectangle is the area that is filled with patterns from rows 7 and 8. Actually, in output, rows 1-6 are filled with patterns from rows 7 and 8. So the rectangle is rows 1-6, columns 1-6. That matches.\n\nExample 3: Horizontal stripe at row 1 columns 1-6. Vertical stripe at column 1 from rows 2-7. The rectangle defined by the intersection of the stripes is the area below the horizontal stripe (rows 2-7) and to the right of the vertical stripe (columns 2-6). That rectangle is rows 2-7, columns 2-6. In input, this rectangle is zeros. In output, it's filled with the pattern from column 1 values repeated horizontally across columns 2-6. So the rule: propagate the values from the vertical stripe (column 1) horizontally across the rectangle.\n\nExample 4: Horizontal stripe at row 0 columns 6-9. Vertical stripe at column 0 rows 0-8. The rectangle defined by the intersection is the area below the horizontal stripe (rows 1-8) and to the right of the vertical stripe (columns 1-9). That rectangle is rows 1-8, columns 1-9. In output, this rectangle is filled with patterns: left side columns 1-4 from rows 7 and 8 alternating, right side columns 6-9 from the row's own column 6 value repeated horizontally. The column 5 is always 0. So the rectangle is subdivided into left part columns 1-4, column 5, and right part columns 6-9. The left part is filled with patterns from rows 7 and 8 alternating. The right part is filled with the row's own column 6 value repeated horizontally. So the rule might be: For each row in the rectangle, fill the left part with patterns from the bottom rows alternating, fill the right part with the row's own column 6 value repeated horizontally.\n\nBut why column 5 is 0? In input, column 5 is 0 for all rows. In output, column 5 remains 0. So maybe column 5 is a separator.\n\nIn example 4, there is a column of zeros at column 5 that acts as a separator between the left part and right part. So the rectangle is split by column 5. The left part columns 1-4 are filled with patterns from bottom rows alternating. The right part columns 6-9 are filled with the row's own column 6 value repeated horizontally.\n\nThus, the general rule might be: There are vertical and horizontal stripes of 5's that define a rectangle. Inside that rectangle, we need to fill it with patterns derived from the bottom rows. The bottom rows may contain patterns that we propagate upward. The propagation might be vertical (for columns) or horizontal (for rows). Also, there might be a separator column (like column 5) that remains zeros.\n\nLet's examine each example again to see if this rule holds.\n\nExample 1: There is a vertical stripe of 5's at column 2 from rows 2-5. There is no horizontal stripe of 5's. So the rectangle defined by the stripe is below the stripe? Actually, the stripe extends from row 2 to 5. The rectangle might be rows 2-4, columns 3-? Actually, the rectangle is below the stripe? Wait, we need to define the rectangle in a consistent way. In examples 2, 3, and 4, the rectangle is defined by the intersection of a vertical stripe and a horizontal stripe. In example 1, there is only a vertical stripe. So maybe the rectangle is defined by the vertical stripe alone: the area to the right of the stripe? But then why fill rows 2-4 with pattern from row 5? Because row 5 is the bottommost row with non-zero values. So we propagate the pattern from that bottom row upward.\n\nLet's analyze example 1 in that context: The vertical stripe of 5's at column 2 from rows 2-5. The rectangle to the right of the stripe is rows 2-5, columns 3-? Actually, columns 3-9. In input, rows 2-4 have zeros in columns 3-9. Row 5 has 6's and 9's in columns 3-8. So the rectangle is rows 2-5, columns 3-9. In output, rows 2-4 are filled with the pattern from row 5 (6's and 9's). So the rule: propagate the pattern from the bottom row of the rectangle upward to all rows in the rectangle. So the rectangle is defined by the vertical stripe. That matches.\n\nExample 2: The rectangle is defined by the vertical stripe at column 0 and the horizontal stripe at row 7. So the rectangle is rows 1-6, columns 1-6. In input, the rectangle is zeros. In output, the rectangle is filled with alternating patterns from rows 7 and 8. So the rule: propagate the patterns from the two bottom rows (rows 7 and 8) upward alternating into the rectangle.\n\nExample 3: The rectangle is defined by the vertical stripe at column 1 and horizontal stripe at row 1. So the rectangle is rows 2-7, columns 2-6. In input, the rectangle is zeros. In output, the rectangle is filled with the values from column 1 repeated horizontally. So the rule: propagate the values from the vertical stripe horizontally into the rectangle.\n\nExample 4: The rectangle is defined by vertical stripe at column 0 and horizontal stripe at row 0. So rectangle is rows 1-8, columns 1-9. In input, the rectangle is zeros except for column 6 values in rows 1-6 (3,3,7,3,7,7). Also, there are patterns at rows 7 and 8 for columns 1-4: 6 3 6 3 and 2 2 2 2. So we have both vertical stripe values (column 6) and bottom row patterns (rows 7 and 8). The output: The rectangle is filled with left part from rows 7 and 8 alternating, right part from the row's own column 6 value repeated horizontally.\n\nThus, the rule seems to be: In the rectangle defined by the vertical stripe of 5's and horizontal stripe of 5's, we fill it with a pattern derived from the bottom rows. If the rectangle has a column of zeros separating two subrectangles (like column 5 in example 4), we treat them separately: the left subrectangle is filled with patterns from the bottom rows alternating; the right subrectangle is filled with the row's own column 6 value repeated horizontally.\n\nBut we need a more general rule that covers all cases.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For each row in the rectangle, fill the region with the value of the nearest non-zero cell in that row that is not part of the stripe. For example, in example 1, the nearest non-zero cell in each row is at column 3-8? Actually, the nearest non-zero cell in row 2 is at column 3? Wait, row 2 has no non-zero cells except 5 at column 2. So the nearest non-zero cell is at column 2? But we propagate the pattern from row 5 instead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: For each row in the rectangle, fill with the pattern of the nearest row that has non-zero values beyond the stripe. In example 1, the nearest row with non-zero values beyond the stripe is row 5. In example 2, the nearest row with non-zero values beyond the stripe is row 7 or 8. But we alternate between them. In example 3, the nearest row with non-zero values beyond the stripe is row 1? Actually, row 1 has 5's at columns 1-6. But we propagate the values from column 1 horizontally. In example 4, the nearest row with non-zero values beyond the stripe is row 7 or 8. We alternate between them for left side, and use the row's own column 6 value for right side.\n\nMaybe the rule: The rectangle is filled by repeating the pattern of the two bottom rows (if there are two) or the pattern of the bottom row (if only one). The pattern may be repeated horizontally or vertically depending on the orientation.\n\nLet's examine each example in terms of \"bottom rows\" pattern.\n\nExample 1: There is only one bottom row with non-zero values beyond the stripe: row 5. So we propagate its pattern upward.\n\nExample 2: There are two bottom rows with non-zero values beyond the stripe: row 7 and row 8. So we propagate them upward alternating.\n\nExample 3: There is one bottom row with non-zero values beyond the stripe: row 1 has 5's. But we propagate the values from column 1 horizontally. Actually, row 1 has 5's at columns 1-6. But we propagate the values from column 1 (2,1,2,6,1,1). Wait, row 1 has 5's at columns 1-6, but we propagate values from column 1 of rows 2-7, not row 1. So maybe the bottom row with non-zero values beyond the stripe is row 1? But row 1 has 5's at columns 1-6, but we don't propagate those 5's. Instead, we propagate the values from column 1 of the rows below. So maybe the rule is: For each row in the rectangle, we fill it with the value from the vertical stripe in that row. In example 3, the vertical stripe is at column 1. So we fill the rectangle horizontally with that value. That matches: For each row, we fill the rectangle with the value from column 1 of that row. So we propagate the vertical stripe values horizontally.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the vertical stripe is at column 0. So for each row in the rectangle, we might fill the rectangle with the value from column 0 of that row? But column 0 has 5 in all rows 1-7. So that would fill the rectangle with 5's, but the output is not 5's. So that can't be.\n\nSo maybe the rule: For each row, we fill the rectangle with the pattern from the bottom rows. But the pattern for each row might be derived from the values of the bottom rows in that row's column(s). Let's analyze more concretely.\n\nExample 2: The rectangle rows 1-6, columns 1-6. In output, row 1 has pattern from row 7. Row 2 from row 8. Row 3 from row 7. Row 4 from row 8. Row 5 from row 7. Row 6 from row 8. So the pattern for each row is exactly the pattern of the row at the same column index in the bottom rows. That is, for row i in the rectangle, we fill the row with the pattern from the bottom row at index i? Let's check: For row 1 (i=1), we use row 7 pattern: 5 4 3 3 4 4 4. For row 2 (i=2), we use row 8 pattern: 5 7 3 7 7 3 3. So we use bottom rows in alternating order, not based on row index. Actually, row 1 uses row 7, row 2 uses row 8, row 3 uses row 7, etc. So the pattern is not based on row index but on alternating between the two bottom rows.\n\nExample 4: For each row in the rectangle (rows 1-6), we fill the left part with pattern from row 7 or 8 alternating. The right part is filled with the row's own column 6 value repeated. So the pattern for each row is a combination of bottom row pattern and row's own value.\n\nExample 1: For each row in the rectangle (rows 2-4), we fill the rectangle with the pattern from row 5.\n\nThus, the rule might be: For each row in the rectangle, we fill it with the pattern from the bottom row(s). But if there is a column of zeros (separator), we treat the left side as pattern from bottom rows alternating, and the right side as the row's own column value repeated.\n\nBut we need to find a consistent rule that covers all examples. Let's attempt to identify a more fundamental principle.\n\nObservations:\n\n- In each example, there is a vertical stripe of 5's that extends downwards from the top. The stripe may start at row 0 or row 1. There is also a horizontal stripe of 5's that extends to the right from the leftmost 5. The stripe may start at row 0 or row 1. The intersection of these stripes is a corner of the rectangle that will be filled.\n\n- The rectangle to be filled is the area below the horizontal stripe and to the right of the vertical stripe. That rectangle may be partially or fully filled in the output.\n\n- The pattern used to fill the rectangle is derived from the rows below the horizontal stripe. The bottom rows that are below the horizontal stripe (i.e., the rows that have non-zero values beyond the vertical stripe) provide the pattern.\n\n- In example 1, the horizontal stripe is at row 5, but there is only one bottom row with pattern beyond the vertical stripe (row 5). So we propagate its pattern upward.\n\n- In example 2, the horizontal stripe is at row 7, and there are two bottom rows with patterns beyond the vertical stripe: row 7 and row 8. We propagate them upward alternating.\n\n- In example 3, the horizontal stripe is at row 1, and there are no bottom rows beyond the horizontal stripe (since the rectangle is below row 1). Actually, the rectangle is rows 2-7, columns 2-6. The bottom rows beyond the horizontal stripe are rows 2-7 themselves, but they have zeros except for column 1 values. So the pattern is derived from the column 1 values of those rows. So we propagate them horizontally.\n\n- In example 4, the horizontal stripe is at row 0, and there are bottom rows with patterns beyond the vertical stripe: rows 7 and 8 provide patterns for columns 1-4. The rows 1-6 provide column 6 values. So we combine them.\n\nThus, the rule might be: For each row in the rectangle, if there is a non-zero value in the row beyond the vertical stripe (i.e., at column > vertical stripe), then we use that value to fill the right side of the rectangle. If there is a non-zero value in the row at column less than the vertical stripe (i.e., on the left side), then we might use that to fill the left side of the rectangle. But in example 4, the left side values are not from the same row; they come from rows 7 and 8. So that doesn't hold.\n\nAlternate approach: The rectangle is subdivided into two halves: left side and right side. The left side may be filled with patterns from the bottom rows, while the right side is filled with the row's own column value repeated horizontally.\n\nBut why does example 4 have a separator column (column 5)? Because the bottom rows (rows 7 and 8) have patterns in columns 1-4 and zeros in column 5. The right side of the rectangle is columns 6-9. So column 5 acts as a separator. In example 1, there is no separator column; the rectangle is continuous. In example 2, there is no separator column; the rectangle is continuous. In example 3, there is no separator column; the rectangle is continuous.\n\nThus, the rule might be: If the bottom rows have patterns in columns left of the separator, fill the left side of the rectangle with those patterns. If the bottom rows have patterns in columns right of the separator, fill the right side of the rectangle with those patterns. If a row in the rectangle has a non-zero value in a column that is not part of the bottom rows pattern, then that value is used to fill the corresponding side of the rectangle for that row.\n\nLet's examine each example in this context.\n\nExample 1: Bottom row (row 5) has pattern in columns 3-8. So the rectangle is columns 3-8. So we fill the rectangle with that pattern for all rows in the rectangle. So the left side and right side are the same because there is no separator. So it's just the pattern from bottom row.\n\nExample 2: Bottom rows (rows 7 and 8) have pattern in columns 1-6. So the rectangle is columns 1-6. There is no separator. So we fill the rectangle with the patterns from rows 7 and 8 alternating.\n\nExample 3: Bottom rows (rows 2-7) have pattern in column 1 (the vertical stripe). The rectangle is columns 2-6. The bottom rows have no pattern beyond the vertical stripe. But we still fill the rectangle with the values from column 1 of those rows. So we treat the vertical stripe as the source of values for the rectangle. So the rule: If the bottom rows have no pattern beyond the vertical stripe, then the rectangle is filled with the values from the vertical stripe.\n\nExample 4: Bottom rows (rows 7 and 8) have patterns in columns 1-4 and zeros in columns 5-9? Actually, row 7: 5 6 3 6 3 0 0 0 0 0. Row 8: 5 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So bottom rows have patterns in columns 1-4. There is no pattern in columns 6-9. However, rows 1-6 have patterns in column 6 (3 or 7). So the rectangle is columns 1-9. The bottom rows provide patterns for left side columns 1-4; the rows 1-6 provide patterns for right side columns 6-9. So we combine them. The separator column 5 remains zero.\n\nThus, the rule: For each side of the rectangle (left side columns 1-4, right side columns 6-9), fill it with the pattern from the bottom rows that have values in that side. If the bottom rows don't have values for a side, use the values from the rows themselves for that side.\n\nBut how do we decide which side is left and which is right? It depends on the location of the separator column (column 5). But maybe the rule is: The rectangle is split by the column of zeros (the column that is zero in all rows of the rectangle). The left side is the part left of that column; the right side is the part right of that column. The bottom rows provide patterns for the left side if they have non-zero values there; otherwise the rows themselves provide patterns for the right side.\n\nBut we need a more formal rule.\n\nLet's analyze the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: all zeros\nRow 1: 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 2: 4 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 3: 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 4: 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 5: 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 6: 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 8 6 8\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 3\nRow 9: all zeros\n\nLet's identify stripes.\n\nVertical stripe at column 0: rows 1-6 have 5 at column 0. Row 0 has 0, row 7-9 have 0 at column 0. So vertical stripe at column 0 extends from row 1 to 6.\n\nVertical stripe at column 6: rows 1-8 have 5 at column 6. Row 0 has 0 at column 6. Row 9 has 0. So vertical stripe at column 6 extends from row 1 to 8.\n\nHorizontal stripe at row 1: columns 0-4 are 5, column 6 is 5. So horizontal stripe at row 1 extends from column 0 to 4, and also at column 6. But is that considered a horizontal stripe? In previous examples, the horizontal stripe is continuous: row 0 columns 6-9, row 1 columns 0-4, etc. In test input, row 1 has 5 at columns 0-4, then 0 at column 5, then 5 at column 6. So there is a gap at column 5. So maybe the horizontal stripe is broken into two segments: columns 0-4 and column 6. But we need to see how that fits with the rectangle.\n\nThe rectangle defined by the intersection of the vertical stripe at column 0 and the horizontal stripe at row 1 would be rows 2-8, columns 1-? Actually, the rectangle would be rows 2-8, columns 1-? The horizontal stripe at row 1 extends to column 4 (and also at column 6). But the rectangle is below row 1, so rows 2-8. The rectangle's columns are to the right of column 0: columns 1-9. But the horizontal stripe at row 1 is broken: there is a gap at column 5. So the rectangle might be subdivided by column 5: left part columns 1-4, right part columns 6-9. Column 5 remains zero.\n\nThus, the rectangle is rows 2-8, columns 1-9. The left part columns 1-4 will be filled with patterns from bottom rows that have values there (rows 7 and 8 have zeros in columns 1-4? Actually, row 7 and 8 have zeros in columns 1-4. So they don't provide patterns. But maybe the bottom rows with patterns are rows 7 and 8? They have patterns at columns 6-9: row 7: 5 8 6 8; row 8: 5 3 3 3. But those patterns are on the right side, not left side.\n\nThe left side columns 1-4 are currently zeros in rows 2-8. But we might fill them with patterns from the bottom rows? But the bottom rows have zeros there. So maybe we fill them with the values from the left side of the vertical stripe? But the vertical stripe at column 0 has values: row 2: 4, row 3: 2, row 4: 2, row 5: 2, row 6: 1. So maybe we use those values to fill the left side of the rectangle horizontally across columns 1-4. That would be similar to example 3, where the vertical stripe values were used to fill horizontally across the rectangle. But in example 3, the rectangle was below the horizontal stripe and to the right of the vertical stripe. And we filled the rectangle with the vertical stripe values horizontally. So maybe we do the same: for each row, fill columns 1-4 with the value from column 0 of that row. That would fill left side of rectangle with 4,2,2,2,1. But we also need to fill the right side columns 6-9 with the row's own column 6 value repeated horizontally. Let's check if that matches the pattern in example 4.\n\nExample 4: For rows 1-6, left side columns 1-4 were filled with patterns from rows 7 and 8 alternating. But that might be because the bottom rows had patterns in columns 1-4. In test input, bottom rows 7 and 8 have zeros in columns 1-4, so they don't provide patterns. So we need to use the values from the vertical stripe at column 0. That seems plausible.\n\nThus, for rows 2-6, we fill columns 1-4 with the value from column 0 of that row. For row 7, the vertical stripe at column 0 is 0, so we might not fill left side? But row 7 has 0 at column 0. But maybe we still fill left side with something else? Let's see.\n\nIn test input, row 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 8 6 8. Row 7's column 0 is 0. So we cannot use that value. But maybe we use the pattern from the bottom rows (rows 7 and 8) for left side? But rows 7 and 8 have zeros in columns 1-4. So no pattern. So maybe we fill left side with zeros? But that would produce a rectangle with zeros on left side for row 7. But in example 4, the left side for rows 7 and 8 remained unchanged (they were not part of the rectangle). Actually, row 7 and 8 are the bottom rows, not part of the rectangle. So the rectangle is rows 1-6, not 7-8. So in test input, the rectangle might be rows 2-6? Wait, let's determine the rectangle boundaries.\n\nWe have a vertical stripe at column 0 from rows 1-6. We have a horizontal stripe at row 1 from columns 0-4 and column 6. The rectangle defined by these stripes is rows 2-8, columns 1-9. But maybe we exclude rows 7-8 because they are part of the bottom pattern region? In previous examples, the rectangle included rows up to the bottom rows minus 1. In example 2, rectangle rows 1-6, bottom rows 7-8 are outside rectangle. In example 3, rectangle rows 2-7, bottom rows 2-7 are inside rectangle. Wait, we need to check.\n\nExample 3: Vertical stripe at column 1 from rows 2-7. Horizontal stripe at row 1 from columns 1-6. The rectangle defined by intersection is rows 2-7, columns 2-6. The bottom rows of the rectangle are rows 2-7. So the rectangle includes rows 2-7. The bottom rows that provide patterns for the rectangle are also rows 2-7 (the same rows). So the rectangle includes those rows.\n\nExample 4: Vertical stripe at column 0 from rows 0-8. Horizontal stripe at row 0 from columns 6-9. The rectangle defined by intersection is rows 1-8, columns 1-9. The bottom rows of the rectangle are rows 7 and 8 (rows 7-8). They provide patterns for the rectangle. So the rectangle includes rows 1-8. The bottom rows 7-8 are inside the rectangle. So the rectangle includes all rows from 1 to 8.\n\nExample 2: Vertical stripe at column 0 from rows 1-7. Horizontal stripe at row 7 from columns 0-6. The rectangle defined by intersection is rows 1-6, columns 1-6. The bottom rows of the rectangle are rows 7 and 8? Wait, row 8 is below horizontal stripe, but the rectangle is defined by being below horizontal stripe? Actually, the rectangle is below the horizontal stripe and to the right of the vertical stripe. So the rectangle is rows 1-6 (above the horizontal stripe) and columns 1-6 (to the right of vertical stripe). The bottom rows of the rectangle are rows 1-6. But the bottom rows that provide patterns for the rectangle are rows 7 and 8 (below the horizontal stripe). So the rectangle includes rows 1-6, and the patterns come from rows 7-8. So the rectangle does not include the bottom rows that provide patterns.\n\nThus, the rectangle is defined as the area below the horizontal stripe and to the right of the vertical stripe. The bottom rows that provide patterns may or may not be inside the rectangle depending on the relative positions. But in all examples, the rectangle is defined by being below the horizontal stripe and to the right of the vertical stripe. The patterns are taken from the rows below the horizontal stripe, i.e., the bottom rows (the ones that have non-zero values beyond the vertical stripe). The rectangle may include some of those rows if they are also below the horizontal stripe, but in examples 2 and 4, the bottom rows are below the horizontal stripe and inside the rectangle. In example 2, the rectangle is rows 1-6, but the bottom rows providing patterns are rows 7 and 8 (below horizontal stripe). In example 4, rectangle rows 1-8, bottom rows providing patterns are rows 7-8 (which are inside rectangle). In example 3, rectangle rows 2-7, bottom rows providing patterns are rows 2-7 (the same). In example 1, rectangle rows 2-5, bottom rows providing patterns are row 5 (which is inside rectangle). So the rectangle includes the bottom rows providing patterns in some cases.\n\nNow, how to fill the rectangle? It seems that for each row in the rectangle, we need to fill it with a pattern derived from the bottom rows.\n\nWe need to find a consistent rule for generating the pattern for each row.\n\nLet's examine each example again with this perspective.\n\nExample 1:\n\n- Rectangle: rows 2-5, columns 3-8 (since vertical stripe at column 2, horizontal stripe at row 5? Actually, horizontal stripe at row 5 is only at column 2, but we consider the rectangle to be below the horizontal stripe? But horizontal stripe is at row 5, so rectangle is rows 6-? Actually, if horizontal stripe at row 5, rectangle below it would be rows 6-9. But there are no non-zero values there. So maybe horizontal stripe is not considered in this example. So rectangle is defined only by vertical stripe: rows 2-5, columns 3-9. So rectangle includes rows 2-5. The bottom rows providing pattern: row 5. So pattern from row 5: 6 6 6 9 9 9 across columns 3-8. So we fill rows 2-4 with that pattern. That matches.\n\nExample 2:\n\n- Vertical stripe at column 0 from rows 1-7. Horizontal stripe at row 7 from columns 0-6. So rectangle: rows 1-6 (below horizontal stripe? Actually, below horizontal stripe would be rows 8-9; but rectangle is defined as below horizontal stripe? Wait, no, rectangle is below horizontal stripe and to the right of vertical stripe. But horizontal stripe at row 7 means rectangle is rows 8-9? But that's not the case. Actually, the rectangle is defined as the area below the horizontal stripe? That would be rows 8-9. But we see rectangle is rows 1-6. So maybe the rectangle is above horizontal stripe? Let's re-evaluate.\n\nWe need to define rectangle more precisely. In examples 2 and 4, the rectangle seems to be the area between the vertical stripe and the horizontal stripe, but not necessarily below the horizontal stripe. Let's think: In example 2, vertical stripe at column 0 from rows 1-7. Horizontal stripe at row 7 from columns 0-6. The rectangle between them would be rows 1-6, columns 1-6 (i.e., the area between vertical stripe and horizontal stripe). So rectangle is above horizontal stripe, not below. In example 4, vertical stripe at column 0 from rows 0-8. Horizontal stripe at row 0 from columns 6-9. The rectangle between them would be rows 1-8, columns 1-9. So rectangle is below horizontal stripe? Actually, horizontal stripe at row 0, so rectangle below it is rows 1-8. So rectangle is below horizontal stripe. So rectangle can be either above or below horizontal stripe depending on the orientation.\n\nThus, the rectangle is the area between the vertical stripe and the horizontal stripe. That is, the rectangle is the area that is not part of either stripe, but is bounded by them.\n\nSo we need to identify which side of the horizontal stripe is the rectangle: above or below. In example 2, the horizontal stripe is at row 7, and rectangle is above it. In example 4, horizontal stripe is at row 0, rectangle is below it. In example 3, horizontal stripe is at row 1, rectangle is below it. In example 1, there is no horizontal stripe? But we can treat horizontal stripe at row 5? Actually, there is a horizontal stripe at row 5 at column 2 only. But the rectangle is to the right of vertical stripe, maybe above or below? Let's consider that example 1 is a special case where horizontal stripe is not continuous, so we ignore it.\n\nThus, the rectangle is the area between the vertical stripe and horizontal stripe. The rectangle is either above or below the horizontal stripe depending on its position relative to the vertical stripe. The rectangle's vertical extent is from the top of the vertical stripe to the bottom of the vertical stripe? Actually, the rectangle is between the vertical stripe and horizontal stripe, so its vertical extent is from the start of the vertical stripe to the end of the vertical stripe? Let's define: The vertical stripe is a contiguous column of 5's from some row start to some row end. The horizontal stripe is a contiguous row of 5's from some column start to some column end. The rectangle is the region that is bounded by the vertical stripe on one side and the horizontal stripe on another side. It may be above or below the horizontal stripe depending on whether the horizontal stripe is above or below the vertical stripe. But we need to figure out which side of horizontal stripe is the rectangle.\n\nLet's examine each example to see the orientation.\n\nExample 1: Vertical stripe at column 2 from row 2 to 5. Horizontal stripe at row 5 from column 2 only. The rectangle is to the right of vertical stripe, but the horizontal stripe is at the bottom of the rectangle? Actually, the horizontal stripe at row 5 extends only at column 2. So the rectangle is to the right of column 2 and above row 5? Actually, the rectangle is to the right of column 2 and above row 5? But the rectangle includes rows 2-4. So it's above row 5. So rectangle is above the horizontal stripe. So orientation: rectangle is above horizontal stripe.\n\nExample 2: Vertical stripe at column 0 from row 1 to 7. Horizontal stripe at row 7 from column 0 to 6. The rectangle is to the right of column 0 and above row 7. So rectangle is above horizontal stripe.\n\nExample 3: Vertical stripe at column 1 from row 2 to 7. Horizontal stripe at row 1 from column 1 to 6. The rectangle is to the right of column 1 and below row 1. So rectangle is below horizontal stripe.\n\nExample 4: Vertical stripe at column 0 from row 0 to 8. Horizontal stripe at row 0 from column 6 to 9. The rectangle is to the right of column 0 and below row 0. So rectangle is below horizontal stripe.\n\nThus, the rectangle can be above or below horizontal stripe depending on the orientation.\n\nNow, how to fill the rectangle?\n\nObservations:\n\n- The rectangle is filled with patterns derived from the rows that are adjacent to the rectangle: the bottom rows that provide patterns beyond the vertical stripe. In examples where the rectangle is above the horizontal stripe (examples 1 and 2), the patterns come from rows below the horizontal stripe (i.e., the bottom rows). In example 3, the rectangle is below horizontal stripe, and the patterns come from rows above the horizontal stripe (i.e., the vertical stripe). Actually, the patterns come from the vertical stripe values. In example 4, the rectangle is below horizontal stripe, and the patterns come from rows below horizontal stripe (rows 7 and 8). So we need to consider both vertical and horizontal stripe orientation.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For each row in the rectangle, if the row has a non-zero value at a column beyond the vertical stripe (i.e., in the rectangle), then that value is used to fill the rectangle horizontally across that row. If the row does not have such a value, then we use the value from the vertical stripe at that row to fill the rectangle horizontally across that row. Additionally, if there are multiple non-zero values beyond the vertical stripe in that row, we might use the pattern from the bottom rows to fill the rectangle. But we need to unify.\n\nLet's analyze example 4 in more detail to see how the left and right sides are determined.\n\nExample 4: The rectangle is rows 1-8, columns 1-9. Column 5 is zero across all rows. So the rectangle is divided into left part columns 1-4 and right part columns 6-9. For rows 1-6, the left part is filled with patterns from rows 7 and 8 alternating. For rows 1-6, the right part is filled with the row's own column 6 value repeated horizontally. For rows 7-8, they are the bottom rows providing patterns. So the rectangle includes rows 7-8 as well. But we didn't fill them because they are bottom rows? Wait, in output, rows 7-8 remain unchanged: 5 6 3 6 3 0 0 0 0 0 for row 7, 5 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 for row 8. So the rectangle is rows 1-6? Actually, the rectangle includes rows 7-8, but we didn't fill them because they are the bottom rows? But the rectangle might be defined as rows 1-8 inclusive. But the bottom rows 7-8 remain unchanged because they are the source of patterns. So we only fill rows above them? But in example 2, the rectangle rows 1-6 are above rows 7-8. In example 4, the rectangle rows 1-6 are above rows 7-8. So we only fill rows above bottom rows. So the rectangle includes rows 1-6, not 7-8. But the rectangle extends to row 8? Let's see: In example 4, the rectangle is rows 1-8, columns 1-9. But we only fill rows 1-6. Rows 7-8 remain unchanged. So we might consider that the rectangle includes rows 1-8, but we only fill rows above the bottom rows (rows 7-8). That is, we fill rows 1-6. So the rectangle's bottom boundary is the last row before the bottom rows that provide patterns. The bottom rows are the last rows that have non-zero values beyond the vertical stripe. So we fill all rows above them within the rectangle. That matches examples 1, 2, and 4. In example 3, the rectangle is rows 2-7, columns 2-6. The bottom rows that provide patterns are rows 2-7 themselves (since they have values at column 1). But the bottom rows are the same as the rectangle. So we fill all rows in rectangle? But we didn't fill them with patterns from rows below them because there are none. Instead, we use the vertical stripe values. So the rule might be: For each row in the rectangle, if there is a non-zero value beyond the vertical stripe in that row, use that value to fill horizontally across the rectangle. If there is no such value, use the value from the vertical stripe at that row to fill horizontally across the rectangle. Additionally, if the rectangle is divided by a column of zeros, we treat left and right sides separately: left side uses patterns from bottom rows if available; right side uses the row's own column value if available; if not, use vertical stripe value? But we need to unify.\n\nLet's examine each example with this rule:\n\nExample 1: For each row in rectangle (rows 2-5, columns 3-8). For rows 2-4, there is no non-zero value beyond the vertical stripe (col 2). So we use the value from the vertical stripe at that row? But vertical stripe value is 5 for all those rows. So we would fill rows 2-4 with 5's across columns 3-8. But output shows 6's and 9's, not 5's. So this rule fails.\n\nThus, we need a different rule.\n\nLet's think differently: The rectangle is the region between the vertical stripe and horizontal stripe. In that rectangle, there may be non-zero values from the bottom rows (rows below horizontal stripe). Those bottom rows provide patterns for the rectangle. We propagate those patterns upward into the rectangle. In example 1, the rectangle is to the right of vertical stripe. The bottom rows (row 5) provide a pattern of 6's and 9's to the right of the vertical stripe. We propagate that pattern upward into the rectangle. So the rule: For each row in the rectangle, fill it with the pattern of the bottom row(s) that is in the same column(s) as the rectangle. For example 1, we fill with the pattern of row 5. For example 2, we fill with patterns of rows 7 and 8 alternating. For example 4, we fill with patterns of rows 7 and 8 for the left side, and with the row's own column 6 values for the right side. But why does example 4 treat the left side separately? Because the bottom rows have patterns in columns 1-4, but the rows 1-6 have no patterns in columns 1-4. So we use bottom rows for left side. The rows 1-6 have patterns in column 6, so we use those for right side.\n\nThus, the rule might be: For each row in the rectangle, for each column in the rectangle, if the bottom rows have a non-zero value in that column, use that value. If not, use the row's own value (if non-zero). But in example 4, for columns 6-9, the bottom rows have zeros, but the rows 1-6 have non-zero values at column 6. So we use the row's own value. For columns 1-4, the bottom rows have non-zero values (6 3 6 3 for row 7 and 2 2 2 2 for row 8). The rows 1-6 have zeros there. So we use bottom rows' values. That matches: For each column, we check if the bottom rows have non-zero values; if yes, use that pattern; if not, use the row's own value.\n\nBut what about example 1? In example 1, the bottom row row 5 has non-zero values in columns 3-8. So for each column 3-8, we use row 5's value. That matches. For columns 3-8, row 5 has non-zero values. So we use those. For columns 3-8, we use row 5's values. For columns 3-8, we fill rows 2-4 with row 5's values. For columns 3-8, we don't consider the row's own values because they are zeros. So that matches.\n\nExample 2: For each column 1-6, we check bottom rows: row 7 has non-zero values in columns 1-6; row 8 also has non-zero values in columns 1-6. For each column, we might choose a pattern from bottom rows. But we need to decide which row to use. In example 2, we alternate between row 7 and row 8 for each row in the rectangle. But if we apply the rule \"use bottom rows' values for each column\", we would need to decide which bottom row's value to use for each column. But the bottom rows both have values for each column. So we might choose one of them. But the output uses alternating rows: row 1 uses row 7 pattern, row 2 uses row 8 pattern, etc. So it's not column-based but row-based. So our rule needs to be row-based: For each row in the rectangle, we use one of the bottom rows' patterns as the entire row pattern.\n\nThus, the rule might be: For each row in the rectangle, fill it with the pattern of one of the bottom rows that have non-zero values beyond the vertical stripe. The choice of which bottom row to use may alternate between the bottom rows. But why alternate? Because the rectangle is of height equal to the number of rows above the bottom rows. In example 2, the rectangle height is 6 rows (rows 1-6). The bottom rows are 2. So we alternate between them: row 1 uses row 7, row 2 uses row 8, row 3 uses row 7, etc. In example 4, the rectangle height is 6 rows (rows 1-6). The bottom rows are 2. But we alternate between them for the left side only. But for the right side, we use the row's own value. So the rule is more complex.\n\nMaybe we need to think in terms of \"pattern sources\". There are two sources: the bottom rows (rows 7-8) and the rows themselves (rows 1-6). For each row in the rectangle, we may use either source for each column. The columns that have non-zero values in the bottom rows are filled with those values. The columns that have non-zero values in the row itself are filled with those values. If both sources have non-zero values in the same column, maybe we choose one? But in example 4, columns 1-4: bottom rows have non-zero values; rows 1-6 have zeros. So we use bottom rows. Columns 6-9: bottom rows have zeros; rows 1-6 have non-zero values at column 6. So we use row's own values. Column 5 is zero in all, so remains zero. That matches.\n\nIn example 2, bottom rows have non-zero values in columns 1-6. Rows 1-6 have zeros in those columns. So we use bottom rows for all columns. That matches.\n\nIn example 1, bottom row has non-zero values in columns 3-8. Rows 2-4 have zeros in those columns. So we use bottom row for all columns. That matches.\n\nIn example 3, bottom rows (rows 2-7) have non-zero values in column 1 (vertical stripe). Rows 2-7 have zeros in columns 2-6. So for columns 2-6, bottom rows have zeros? Wait, bottom rows have zeros in columns 2-6. So we use row's own values? But row's own values are zeros in columns 2-6. But we fill them with the vertical stripe values (the values at column 1). But bottom rows have zeros in columns 2-6, so we use row's own values? But row's own values are zeros. That would produce zeros, but the output has the vertical stripe values repeated horizontally. So our rule fails.\n\nThus, we need to adjust: In example 3, the rectangle is columns 2-6. The bottom rows (rows 2-7) have zeros in those columns. So we use the row's own values? But row's own values are zeros. But the output uses the vertical stripe values. So maybe the rule is: If the bottom rows have zeros in a column, but the vertical stripe at that row has a non-zero value, we use that value for the rectangle columns. That is, we propagate the vertical stripe values horizontally. So we need to incorporate the vertical stripe as a source as well.\n\nThus, the sources of patterns for each cell in the rectangle might be: bottom rows, vertical stripe, row's own value. We need to decide which to use.\n\nLet's examine each example with this new rule:\n\n- For each cell in the rectangle, we check the following: If the bottom row(s) have a non-zero value in that column, use that value. If not, if the vertical stripe at that row has a non-zero value, use that value. If not, use the row's own value. But in example 4, for columns 1-4, bottom rows have non-zero values; we use them. For columns 6-9, bottom rows have zeros; vertical stripe at those columns? The vertical stripe at column 0 has no value at those columns. So we use row's own value at column 6. That matches. In example 3, for columns 2-6, bottom rows have zeros; vertical stripe at row has non-zero values at column 1; we use those values. That matches. In example 2, for columns 1-6, bottom rows have non-zero values; we use them. That matches. In example 1, for columns 3-8, bottom row has non-zero values; we use them. That matches.\n\nThus, the rule: For each cell in the rectangle, if there is a non-zero value in any of the bottom rows at that column, use that value. If not, if the vertical stripe at that row has a non-zero value, use that value. If not, use the row's own value.\n\nBut we also need to decide which bottom row to use if multiple bottom rows have non-zero values. In example 2, bottom rows 7 and 8 both have non-zero values in columns 1-6. But the output uses one of them for the entire row. But if we apply the rule \"use bottom rows if any\", we need to decide which bottom row's value to use. We might choose the one that is the nearest to the rectangle? But both are at the same distance? Or we might choose the one that is the bottommost? But in example 2, row 7 is the bottommost of the two bottom rows? Actually, row 7 is above row 8? Wait, row 7 is above row 8. So bottommost is row 8. But output uses row 7 for row 1, row 8 for row 2, etc. So it's not always bottommost. It alternates. So we need a rule for selecting which bottom row's pattern to use for each row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: For each row in the rectangle, we use the pattern from the bottom row that is at the same relative position from the bottom of the rectangle. That is, we map the rectangle rows to the bottom rows in a cyclic manner. For example, in example 2, rectangle rows 1-6 correspond to bottom rows 7-8 repeated. The mapping: row 1 -> bottom row 7 (top of bottom rows), row 2 -> bottom row 8, row 3 -> bottom row 7, row 4 -> bottom row 8, etc. So the mapping is: For each row in rectangle, find the corresponding bottom row by computing (row index relative to top of rectangle) mod number of bottom rows + bottom row start. But in example 4, we had two bottom rows as well. But we didn't use them for the entire row; we used them for left side only. So the mapping might be: For each row in rectangle, we use the pattern from the bottom row that is at the same relative position for columns where bottom rows have non-zero values. For columns where bottom rows have zeros, we use the row's own value. That would produce the pattern in example 4: For left side columns 1-4, bottom rows have non-zero values, so we use them. For right side columns 6-9, bottom rows have zeros, so we use row's own value at column 6 repeated horizontally. That matches.\n\nThus, the rule might be: For each cell in the rectangle, if any of the bottom rows have a non-zero value in that column, we use the value from the bottom row that corresponds to that rectangle row's position relative to the bottom rows. If none of the bottom rows have a non-zero value in that column, we use the row's own value at that column (if any). If the row's own value is zero, we might use the vertical stripe value at that row (if non-zero). But in example 3, for columns 2-6, the row's own values are zero, but the vertical stripe at column 1 has non-zero values. So we use those.\n\nBut we need to decide which bottom row to use for each rectangle row. In example 2, we used bottom rows 7 and 8 alternating. In example 4, we used bottom rows 7 and 8 for left side only. But we could still use them for the entire row if we consider the entire rectangle. But we didn't because for columns 6-9, bottom rows had zeros, so we used row's own values. So the mapping is column-based: For each column, we use the bottom row's value if non-zero; else use row's own value; else vertical stripe. That seems to produce the correct output.\n\nLet's test this rule on all examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\n- Bottom rows: row 5 only (since row 5 is the last row with non-zero values beyond vertical stripe). So bottom rows = [row5].\n- For each cell in rectangle (rows 2-5, columns 3-8):\n  - If bottom row (row5) has non-zero value in that column, use it. Row5 has 6 in columns 3-5 and 9 in columns 6-8. So we use those values.\n  - If bottom row has zero in that column, we use row's own value (but row's own values are zeros). So we use zeros. But row5 has non-zero values in all columns 3-8. So we use row5's values. So rows 2-4 get row5's values. That matches output.\n\nExample 2:\n\n- Bottom rows: rows 7 and 8. They have non-zero values in columns 1-6. So for each cell in rectangle (rows 1-6, columns 1-6):\n  - For each column, bottom rows have non-zero values. So we need to decide which bottom row's value to use. The rule: For each rectangle row, use the bottom row pattern that corresponds to that rectangle row's position relative to the bottom rows. That is, we map rectangle rows to bottom rows cyclically: row 1 -> row7, row2 -> row8, row3 -> row7, row4 -> row8, row5 -> row7, row6 -> row8. So for each rectangle row, we use the entire row pattern from the corresponding bottom row. That matches output.\n\nExample 3:\n\n- Bottom rows: rows 2-7. They have non-zero values only at column 1. So for each cell in rectangle (rows 2-7, columns 2-6):\n  - For each column, bottom rows have zeros. So we use row's own value? But row's own values are zeros. So we use vertical stripe value at column 1? But vertical stripe is at column 1. So we use that value. That matches output.\n\nBut how do we incorporate vertical stripe? In example 3, bottom rows have zeros for columns 2-6. So we use row's own value? But row's own values are zeros. But we use vertical stripe value. So we need a rule: If bottom rows have zeros for that column, and the row's own value is zero, but the vertical stripe at that row has a non-zero value, we use the vertical stripe value.\n\nBut why not use the vertical stripe value directly for all columns? Because in example 1 and 2, the vertical stripe value is 5 in all rows. But we didn't use it. So we need a rule: Use vertical stripe value only if bottom rows have zeros for that column. That matches.\n\nExample 4:\n\n- Bottom rows: rows 7 and 8. They have non-zero values in columns 1-4 (for row7: 6,3,6,3; for row8: 2,2,2,2). They have zeros in columns 5-9. So for each cell in rectangle (rows 1-8, columns 1-9):\n  - For columns 1-4: bottom rows have non-zero values. So we use bottom row's value for that rectangle row. The rectangle rows are 1-8. For each rectangle row, we map to bottom row pattern cyclically: row1->row7, row2->row8, row3->row7, row4->row8, row5->row7, row6->row8, row7->row7? Wait, row7 is bottom row itself. But we may not fill bottom rows. Actually, rectangle rows 1-8 includes rows 7 and 8. But we might treat them differently. But we need to see output: rows 7 and 8 remain unchanged. So we don't fill them. So rectangle rows 1-6 only. But we can still apply mapping: row1->row7, row2->row8, row3->row7, row4->row8, row5->row7, row6->row8. So we fill rows 1-6 with left part from bottom rows accordingly. That matches output: row1 left part uses row7 pattern (6 3 6 3), row2 left part uses row8 pattern (2 2 2 2), etc.\n\n- For columns 6-9: bottom rows have zeros. So we use row's own value at column 6 repeated horizontally. That matches output: row1 right part uses 3 3 3 3, row2 uses 3 3 3 3, row3 uses 7 7 7 7, etc. Wait, row3 right part uses 7 7 7 7. Row3's column 6 is 7. Yes. So we use row's own value at column 6. For row4 right part uses 3 3 3 3. Row4's column 6 is 3. Yes. Row5 right part uses 7 7 7 7. Row5's column 6 is 7. Row6 right part uses 7 7 7 7. Row6's column 6 is 7. That matches.\n\n- Column 5: bottom rows have zeros. Row's own value at column 5 is 0. So we use 0. That matches.\n\nThus, the rule: For each cell in the rectangle, we first check if any of the bottom rows have a non-zero value in that column. If so, we use that value. If not, we check if the row's own value in that column is non-zero; if so, we use that. If not, we check if the vertical stripe at that row has a non-zero value; if so, we use that. If still zero, we keep zero.\n\nBut we need to decide which bottom row's value to use if multiple bottom rows have non-zero values for that column. In examples, there were at most two bottom rows. And we used a cyclic mapping: For each rectangle row, we use the pattern of one of the bottom rows. But in the rule above, we didn't specify which bottom row to use. We just said \"if any of the bottom rows have a non-zero value\". But if multiple bottom rows have non-zero values, we need to decide which one to pick. In examples, we used the pattern from the bottom row that matches the rectangle row's position relative to the bottom rows. That is, we map rectangle rows to bottom rows cyclically. So the rule is: For each rectangle row, we choose one of the bottom rows as a source pattern, based on the rectangle row's index relative to the bottom rows. Then we fill the entire rectangle row with that pattern. But in example 4, we didn't use a single bottom row pattern for the entire row; we used bottom row pattern only for columns 1-4, and used row's own values for columns 6-9. That suggests that the mapping is column-based, not row-based. But we can think of it as: For each rectangle row, we have a pattern from the bottom rows for each column. For columns where bottom rows have values, we use those values. For columns where bottom rows have zeros, we use row's own values.\n\nBut if bottom rows have values for some columns but not others, we need to decide which bottom row to use for each column. But if bottom rows have values for all columns, we need to decide which bottom row to use for each rectangle row. But we can still use the mapping: For each rectangle row, we choose one bottom row pattern for all columns. But in example 4, bottom rows have values only for columns 1-4. So for columns 6-9, bottom rows have zeros. So we use row's own values. So we don't need to choose bottom row for those columns. So the mapping still works: For each rectangle row, we choose a bottom row pattern for the columns where bottom rows have values. For columns where bottom rows have zeros, we use row's own values. That matches.\n\nThus, the rule can be: For each rectangle row, we determine a \"bottom row pattern\" to use for columns where bottom rows have non-zero values. The pattern is chosen by mapping rectangle rows to bottom rows cyclically. For columns where bottom rows have zeros, we use the row's own value. For columns where row's own value is zero, we use the vertical stripe value if available. That seems to produce the outputs.\n\nLet's test this rule on all examples.\n\nExample 1: bottom rows = [row5]. So for each rectangle row, we map to row5. For columns 3-8, bottom row row5 has non-zero values. So we use those values for all rectangle rows. For columns 3-8, row's own values are zeros. So we use bottom row values. That matches.\n\nExample 2: bottom rows = [row7, row8]. For rectangle rows 1-6, we map row1->row7, row2->row8, row3->row7, row4->row8, row5->row7, row6->row8. For each rectangle row, we use the pattern of the corresponding bottom row for columns 1-6. Bottom rows have non-zero values for all those columns. So we use those values. That matches output.\n\nExample 3: bottom rows = [row2, row3, row4, row5, row6, row7] (since rows 2-7 have values at column 1). But these bottom rows have zeros in columns 2-6. So for each rectangle row (rows 2-7), we map to a bottom row pattern. But bottom rows have zeros for columns 2-6. So we use row's own values? Row's own values are zeros. So we use vertical stripe value at column 1? Wait, vertical stripe value at column 1 is non-zero for each row. But our rule says: If bottom row has zero for a column, we use row's own value. But row's own value is zero. So we would use 0. But we want to use vertical stripe value. So we need to incorporate vertical stripe as fallback. So we need to adjust rule: If bottom row has zero for a column, and row's own value is zero, then use vertical stripe value if non-zero. That would fill columns 2-6 with vertical stripe value at column 1. That matches output.\n\nExample 4: bottom rows = [row7, row8]. For rectangle rows 1-6, map row1->row7, row2->row8, row3->row7, row4->row8, row5->row7, row6->row8. For each rectangle row, for columns 1-4, bottom rows have non-zero values. So we use bottom row pattern for those columns. For columns 6-9, bottom rows have zeros. So we use row's own value. Row's own value at column 6 is non-zero. So we use that repeated horizontally. For column 5, bottom rows have zero, row's own value at column 5 is zero, vertical stripe value at column 0 is 5 but that is at column 0, not relevant. So we keep 0. That matches output.\n\nThus, the rule works.\n\nNow we need to apply this rule to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: all zeros\nRow 1: 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 2: 4 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 3: 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 4: 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 5: 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 6: 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 8 6 8\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 3\nRow 9: all zeros\n\nWe need to identify vertical stripe(s) and horizontal stripe(s). There are two vertical stripes: column 0 from rows 1-6, and column 6 from rows 1-8. There is a horizontal stripe at row 1: columns 0-4 and column 6. But there is a gap at column 5. So the horizontal stripe is broken into two segments: segment 1: columns 0-4; segment 2: column 6. But we might treat them as two separate horizontal stripes. But the rectangle defined by the intersection of vertical stripe and horizontal stripe might be split accordingly: left part columns 1-4 (between vertical stripe at column 0 and horizontal stripe segment 1 at row 1). Right part columns 7-9 (between vertical stripe at column 6 and horizontal stripe segment 2 at row 1). Wait, the horizontal stripe at row 1 extends to column 6, but not beyond. So the rectangle to the right of vertical stripe at column 0 is columns 1-9. But we need to consider the horizontal stripe at row 1 as the top boundary of the rectangle. So the rectangle is rows 2-8, columns 1-9. But we also have a vertical stripe at column 6, which might split the rectangle into two subrectangles: left part columns 1-5, right part columns 7-9. But column 5 is zero. But the vertical stripe at column 6 is part of the rectangle? Actually, vertical stripe at column 6 is part of the rectangle's boundary? Let's think: The rectangle defined by vertical stripe at column 0 and horizontal stripe at row 1 is the area below row 1 and to the right of column 0: rows 2-9, columns 1-9. But we also have a vertical stripe at column 6 that goes from rows 1-8. That vertical stripe is inside the rectangle. But in example 4, the vertical stripe at column 6 was part of the rectangle boundary? Wait, in example 4, the vertical stripe at column 0 and horizontal stripe at row 0 defined the rectangle. But there was also a vertical stripe at column 6 that extended from row 1-8. That vertical stripe was inside the rectangle? Actually, the rectangle in example 4 is rows 1-8, columns 1-9. The vertical stripe at column 6 is inside that rectangle. But we didn't treat it as a boundary; we just used it as a separator column. So maybe in test input, we have a vertical stripe at column 6 inside the rectangle, and it acts as a separator column.\n\nThus, the rectangle is rows 2-8, columns 1-9. The vertical stripe at column 6 splits the rectangle into left part columns 1-5 and right part columns 7-9. Column 5 is zero. So the rectangle is split by column 5 (separator) and column 6 (vertical stripe). Actually, the vertical stripe at column 6 is a column of 5's that is inside the rectangle. But we might treat it as part of the rectangle or as a boundary. But we need to decide how to fill.\n\nLet's analyze the patterns in test input.\n\nWe have bottom rows that provide patterns beyond the vertical stripe at column 6: rows 7 and 8 have values at columns 6-9: row 7: 5 8 6 8; row 8: 5 3 3 3. So bottom rows provide patterns for right side columns 6-9.\n\nWe also have bottom rows that provide patterns left of vertical stripe at column 0: rows 2-6 have values at column 0: 4,2,2,2,1. So bottom rows provide patterns for left side columns 1-4? Actually, rows 2-6 have values at column 0. But these values might be used to fill left side columns 1-4. In example 3, we used vertical stripe values to fill rectangle horizontally. But in test input, we might use column 0 values to fill left side columns 1-4.\n\nBut we also have bottom rows that provide patterns for left side columns 1-4? Actually, rows 7 and 8 have zeros in columns 1-4. So they don't provide patterns for left side. So the only patterns for left side are from rows 2-6 via column 0. But column 0 values are 4,2,2,2,1. But we need to decide if we use them to fill left side columns 1-4 for rows 2-6. That seems plausible.\n\nNow, we need to fill the rectangle rows 2-8, columns 1-9. But we need to decide which rows to fill. In examples, we fill rows above the bottom rows. Bottom rows are rows 7 and 8. So we fill rows 2-6 (above bottom rows). But we also might fill row 7? In example 4, we didn't fill rows 7-8 because they are bottom rows. So we likely don't fill rows 7-8. So we fill rows 2-6.\n\nThus, output will modify rows 2-6 only.\n\nNow, we need to fill each row in rows 2-6.\n\nWe need to decide the pattern for each row.\n\nWe have two sources: bottom rows (rows 7 and 8) and row's own values.\n\nWe also have a separator column (column 5). In test input, column 5 is zero across all rows. So the rectangle might be split into left side columns 1-4 and right side columns 6-9. The vertical stripe at column 6 might be part of the rectangle but also acts as a boundary between left and right sides.\n\nBut we need to decide how to fill left side columns 1-4: we should use bottom rows' values if available. Bottom rows 7 and 8 have zeros in columns 1-4. So we cannot use them. So we should use row's own values? But row's own values at columns 1-4 are zeros. So we need to use vertical stripe values at column 0? In example 3, we used vertical stripe values to fill rectangle horizontally. So we might use column 0 values for left side columns 1-4. But column 0 values for rows 2-6 are 4,2,2,2,1. So we would fill left side columns 1-4 for each row with that value repeated horizontally. That would produce:\n\nRow 2 left side: 4 4 4 4\nRow 3 left side: 2 2 2 2\nRow 4 left side: 2 2 2 2\nRow 5 left side: 2 2 2 2\nRow 6 left side: 1 1 1 1\n\nBut we need to check if that matches the pattern in the output of example 4. In example 4, left side columns 1-4 were filled with patterns from bottom rows, not from vertical stripe. But in test input, bottom rows have no patterns for left side. So we use vertical stripe. That seems plausible.\n\nNow, for right side columns 6-9: we should use bottom rows' values if available. Bottom rows 7 and 8 have values at columns 6-9. So we can use them. For each rectangle row, we need to decide which bottom row's pattern to use. We might map rectangle rows 2-6 to bottom rows 7 and 8 cyclically: row 2->row7, row 3->row8, row 4->row7, row 5->row8, row 6->row7. Or we might use a different mapping. Let's examine example 4: For left side, we used bottom rows cyclically. For right side, we used row's own values, not bottom rows. But here, bottom rows have values for right side columns 6-9. Row's own values at column 6 are zeros? Actually, row 2 has 5 at column 6? Wait, row 2: 4 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So row 2's column 6 is 5. Row 3: 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. Row 4: 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. Row 5: 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. Row 6: 1 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So all rows 2-6 have 5 at column 6. So row's own value at column 6 is 5. So if we use row's own values, we would fill right side columns 6-9 with 5 5 5 5 for all rows 2-6. But bottom rows have values 8,6,8 for row 7 and 3,3,3 for row 8. So if we use bottom rows' values, we would have different patterns. Which one is correct? We need to decide based on the rule.\n\nIn example 4, we used bottom rows' values for left side columns 1-4, because bottom rows had values there. For right side columns 6-9, bottom rows had zeros, so we used row's own values. So we used bottom rows only where they had non-zero values. In test input, bottom rows have non-zero values for right side columns 6-9. So we should use bottom rows' values for right side columns 6-9. For left side columns 1-4, bottom rows have zeros, so we should use row's own values? But row's own values at columns 1-4 are zeros. So we should use vertical stripe values at column 0. That matches earlier.\n\nThus, we will fill right side columns 6-9 with bottom rows' values. For each rectangle row, we need to choose a bottom row pattern. We might map rectangle rows to bottom rows cyclically: row 2->row7, row 3->row8, row 4->row7, row 5->row8, row 6->row7. That would produce right side patterns:\n\nRow 2: 5 8 6 8 (from row7)\nRow 3: 5 3 3 3 (from row8)\nRow 4: 5 8 6 8 (from row7)\nRow 5: 5 3 3 3 (from row8)\nRow 6: 5 8 6 8 (from row7)\n\nBut we need to consider that bottom rows 7 and 8 have 5 at column 6 as well. So the pattern for right side columns 6-9 includes 5 at column 6 and 8,6,8 at columns 7-9? Wait, row7: 5 8 6 8. That means column 6=5, column 7=8, column 8=6, column 9=8. Row8: 5 3 3 3. So column 6=5, column 7=3, column 8=3, column 9=3. So the pattern for right side columns 6-9 is exactly the entire row of row7 or row8. But we only need columns 6-9. So we will copy columns 6-9 from bottom rows.\n\nThus, we will fill rows 2-6, columns 6-9 with patterns from bottom rows cyclically.\n\nNow, what about column 5? In test input, column 5 is zero across all rows. In example 4, column 5 remained zero. So we will keep column 5 as zero.\n\nNow, what about column 0? In test input, column 0 values are 5 for rows 1-6, 4 for row 2, 2 for rows 3-5, 1 for row 6. But we might keep them unchanged. In example 4, column 0 values remained unchanged. In example 2, column 0 values remained unchanged. In example 1, column 0 values remained zeros. So we keep column 0 unchanged.\n\nNow, what about column 1-4? We plan to fill them with the vertical stripe values repeated horizontally. But we need to confirm if that is correct. In example 3, we filled columns 2-6 with values from column 1 repeated horizontally. In test input, we might fill columns 1-4 with values from column 0 repeated horizontally. That seems plausible.\n\nHowever, we need to check if any other patterns might apply. For example, maybe the rectangle is defined by the intersection of the vertical stripe at column 6 and the horizontal stripe at row 1? Let's consider that possibility.\n\nIn test input, there is a vertical stripe at column 6 from rows 1-8. There is a horizontal stripe at row 1 from columns 0-4 and column 6. The rectangle defined by vertical stripe at column 6 and horizontal stripe at row 1 is rows 2-8, columns 7-9? Actually, the rectangle between vertical stripe at column 6 and horizontal stripe at row 1 would be rows 2-8, columns 7-9. But we also have a vertical stripe at column 0 that might define another rectangle. But the rectangle might be defined by the intersection of the two vertical stripes and horizontal stripe. But we need to decide which rectangle we fill.\n\nLet's examine the training examples to see how many rectangles there are. In example 4, there was a vertical stripe at column 0 and horizontal stripe at row 0. The rectangle was rows 1-8, columns 1-9. There was also a vertical stripe at column 6 inside that rectangle. But we didn't consider a separate rectangle for that vertical stripe. We treated it as a separator. So we treat only one rectangle: the area between the vertical stripe at column 0 and horizontal stripe at row 0. In test input, we have vertical stripe at column 0 and horizontal stripe at row 1. So rectangle is rows 2-8, columns 1-9. We also have vertical stripe at column 6 inside that rectangle. So we treat column 6 as a separator. So we will fill rectangle rows 2-8, columns 1-9.\n\nBut we might also need to consider the horizontal stripe at row 1 being broken into two segments: columns 0-4 and column 6. But we treat the rectangle as the area below row 1 and to the right of column 0. The horizontal stripe at row 1 is a boundary, but it has a gap at column 5. But the rectangle still extends to column 9. So we need to fill columns 1-9. But we might treat column 5 as a separator because it is zero. But we might also treat column 6 as a separator because it's a vertical stripe. But the rule we used in example 4 considered column 5 as a separator because bottom rows had zeros there. But here, column 5 is zero in all rows, so it might act as a separator. But we also have column 6 as a vertical stripe of 5's, which might act as a separator too. But we need to decide how to fill each part.\n\nIn example 4, we had a vertical stripe at column 6 inside the rectangle. The rectangle was columns 1-9. Column 6 had 0 values in rows 1-6, but had 0 in rows 1-6? Wait, row 1 had 0 at column 6? Actually, in example 4 input, row 1 had 3 at column 6? Wait, let's check example 4 input:\n\nRow 1: 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So row 1 had 3 at column 6. Row 2: 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So column 6 has 3 for rows 1-6. So vertical stripe at column 6 is not all zeros. It's a vertical stripe of 3's at column 6 for rows 1-6. Wait, check input row 7: 5 6 3 6 3 0 0 0 0 0. So column 6 is 0 at row 7. Row 8: 5 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So column 6 is 0 at row 8. So vertical stripe at column 6 is present in rows 1-6. So we had a vertical stripe of 3's at column 6 inside the rectangle. But in the output, the right side columns 6-9 were filled with 3's or 7's. So we used the values from column 6 of the rectangle rows. So the vertical stripe at column 6 inside the rectangle is used as a source for the right side.\n\nIn test input, vertical stripe at column 6 is also present in rows 1-6 with values 5 at column 6. So we might use that as a source for the right side. But we also have bottom rows 7-8 with values at columns 6-9. So we need to decide whether to use the row's own value (which is 5 at column 6) or bottom rows' values for right side columns 6-9.\n\nIn example 4, for right side columns 6-9, we used the row's own value at column 6 repeated horizontally. We did not use bottom rows' values because bottom rows had zeros at those columns. In test input, bottom rows have non-zero values at columns 6-9. So we might use bottom rows' values for right side columns 6-9. But we also have the row's own value at column 6, which is 5. But bottom rows also have 5 at column 6. So the row's own value matches the bottom rows' value at column 6. So we might choose either. But if we use bottom rows' values for columns 7-9, we might get patterns 8,6,8 or 3,3,3. That would produce a pattern that alternates between row 7 and row 8. But if we use row's own value repeated horizontally for all columns 6-9, we would get 5 5 5 5 for all rows 2-6. Which one is more plausible? We need to consider the rule: For each cell, if bottom rows have non-zero values in that column, use that value. That would override row's own value. So we would use bottom rows' values for columns 6-9. That would produce the alternating pattern.\n\nThus, we need to decide which bottom row pattern to use for each rectangle row. We might map rectangle rows to bottom rows cyclically: row 2->row7, row 3->row8, row 4->row7, row 5->row8, row 6->row7. That would produce the right side patterns as above.\n\nNow, we need to consider left side columns 1-4. Bottom rows have zeros there. So we use row's own value at those columns? Row's own values at columns 1-4 are zeros. So we need to use vertical stripe values at column 0 repeated horizontally. That would produce left side patterns as earlier.\n\nThus, the output will be:\n\nRow 0: unchanged (all zeros)\nRow 1: unchanged: 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 2: left side columns 1-4: 4 4 4 4; column 5: 0; column 6-9: from row7 pattern: 5 8 6 8\nRow 3: left side columns 1-4: 2 2 2 2; column 5: 0; column 6-9: from row8 pattern: 5 3 3 3\nRow 4: left side columns 1-4: 2 2 2 2; column 5: 0; column 6-9: from row7 pattern: 5 8 6 8\nRow 5: left side columns 1-4: 2 2 2 2; column 5: 0; column 6-9: from row8 pattern: 5 3 3 3\nRow 6: left side columns 1-4: 1 1 1 1; column 5: 0; column 6-9: from row7 pattern: 5 8 6 8\nRow 7: unchanged: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 8 6 8\nRow 8: unchanged: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 3\nRow 9: unchanged: all zeros\n\nWait, we need to check if row 6 is within rectangle? The rectangle is rows 2-8. So row 6 is inside rectangle. So we fill row 6 accordingly. But we need to decide whether we fill rows 2-6 only or 2-8? In example 4, rectangle rows 1-8, but we didn't fill rows 7-8 because they are bottom rows. In test input, bottom rows are rows 7 and 8. So we fill rows 2-6. So row 7 and 8 remain unchanged. That matches.\n\nThus, output row 6 will be filled as above.\n\nNow, we need to produce the full output grid with 10 rows of 10 numbers each.\n\nLet's write the output grid:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 2: 4 4 4 4 4? Wait, we need to fill column 5? Actually, we need to fill columns 1-4 with 4 4 4 4. Column 5 remains 0. Column 6-9 from row7: 5 8 6 8. But we need to keep column 0 unchanged: 4 at column 0. So row 2 should be: 4 (col0) 4 (col1) 4 (col2) 4 (col3) 4 (col4) 0 (col5) 5 (col6) 8 (col7) 6 (col8) 8 (col9). Wait, we need to check: In row 2 input, column 0 is 4. So we keep 4. Column 1-4: fill with 4. Column 5: 0. Column 6: 5. Column 7-9: 8,6,8. So row 2: 4 4 4 4 4 0 5 8 6 8.\n\nBut we need to check if we should fill column 4 with 4 or 5? Actually, the rectangle includes columns 1-9. But we fill columns 1-4 with the vertical stripe value repeated horizontally. That means columns 1-4 get the value 4. So column 4 is 4. So row 2: 4 4 4 4 4 0 5 8 6 8. But we need to check if we should keep column 4 as 5 or 4? In input, row 2 column 4 is 0. We are filling it with 4. So it's 4. That seems fine.\n\nNow, row 3: column 0 is 2. Columns 1-4 fill with 2. Column 5 0. Column 6-9 from row8: 5 3 3 3. So row 3: 2 2 2 2 2 0 5 3 3 3.\n\nRow 4: column 0 is 2. Columns 1-4 fill with 2. Column 5 0. Column 6-9 from row7: 5 8 6 8. So row 4: 2 2 2 2 2 0 5 8 6 8.\n\nRow 5: column 0 is 2. Columns 1-4 fill with 2. Column 5 0. Column 6-9 from row8: 5 3 3 3. So row 5: 2 2 2 2 2 0 5 3 3 3.\n\nRow 6: column 0 is 1. Columns 1-4 fill with 1. Column 5 0. Column 6-9 from row7: 5 8 6 8. So row 6: 1 1 1 1 1 0 5 8 6 8.\n\nRow 7: unchanged: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 8 6 8\n\nRow 8: unchanged: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 3\n\nRow 9: unchanged: all zeros\n\nBut we need to check if we need to fill column 4 with 5 or 4? Wait, we need to check the rectangle boundaries: The rectangle is defined by vertical stripe at column 0 and horizontal stripe at row 1. So rectangle columns are 1-9. But column 4 is inside rectangle. So we fill it with the vertical stripe value repeated horizontally. So we fill with 4 for row 2. That matches.\n\nBut we need to check if we should fill column 5 with something else. Column 5 is inside rectangle but is zero. In example 4, column 5 remained zero. So we keep it zero.\n\nNow, we need to verify if there is any other pattern that might apply to the left side columns 1-4. In example 4, we used bottom rows' patterns for left side columns 1-4. In test input, bottom rows 7-8 have zeros there, so we use vertical stripe values. That seems consistent.\n\nNow, we need to verify if we need to fill column 6 with the row's own value (5) or bottom row's value (5). They are the same. So it's fine.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill column 7-9 with bottom rows' values or row's own values. Bottom rows have values 8,6,8 for row 7 and 3,3,3 for row 8. Row's own values at columns 7-9 are zeros. So we must use bottom rows' values. That matches the rule.\n\nNow, we need to decide mapping of rectangle rows to bottom rows for columns 6-9. We used cyclic mapping: row 2->row7, row 3->row8, row 4->row7, row 5->row8, row 6->row7. That yields the pattern we wrote.\n\nBut is this mapping correct? In example 2, we used cyclic mapping. In example 4, we used cyclic mapping for left side columns 1-4. For right side columns 6-9, we used row's own values because bottom rows had zeros. So the mapping only applied to columns where bottom rows have non-zero values. So in test input, we should apply mapping to columns 6-9. So mapping row 2->row7, row 3->row8, row 4->row7, row 5->row8, row 6->row7. That seems consistent.\n\nBut we need to confirm if we should map row 2->row7 or row 2->row8. In example 2, mapping was row 1->row7, row 2->row8, row 3->row7, row 4->row8, row 5->row7, row 6->row8. That is, the mapping starts with row 7 for the first rectangle row. So for row 2, we start with row 7. So row 2->row7. That matches.\n\nNow, we need to confirm if the rectangle includes row 8? No, row 8 is a bottom row. So we exclude it.\n\nThus, final output grid:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 2: 4 4 4 4 4 0 5 8 6 8\nRow 3: 2 2 2 2 2 0 5 3 3 3\nRow 4: 2 2 2 2 2 0 5 8 6 8\nRow 5: 2 2 2 2 2 0 5 3 3 3\nRow 6: 1 1 1 1 1 0 5 8 6 8\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 8 6 8\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 3 3\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut we need to check if column 4 should be 4 or 5? Let's check the input for row 2: column 4 is 0. We fill with 4. So it's 4. That's correct.\n\nNow, we need to double-check the rule for left side columns 1-4. In example 3, we used the vertical stripe values to fill horizontally. In test input, vertical stripe values are at column 0: 4,2,2,2,1. So we fill left side columns 1-4 with those values. That seems correct.\n\nBut we need to check if any other pattern might override that. For example, bottom rows might have patterns in columns 1-4? They don't. So we keep vertical stripe.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill column 5 with something else. Column 5 is zero. So we keep zero.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill column 6 with something else. Column 6 is 5 for all rows 2-6. So we keep 5. But we also might override with bottom rows' value? But bottom rows also have 5 at column 6. So it's consistent.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill column 7-9 with bottom rows' values. We did.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 7 and 8. In example 4, we left bottom rows unchanged. So we leave them unchanged.\n\nThus, the output grid above is plausible.\n\nBut we need to verify if there might be any other rule that could produce a different output. Let's examine the training examples again to see if there is any nuance that might change the output.\n\nExample 1: The rectangle was to the right of the vertical stripe. The bottom row had pattern 6's and 9's. We used that pattern for all rows above. That matches.\n\nExample 2: The rectangle was to the right of the vertical stripe and above the horizontal stripe. The bottom rows had patterns. We used them alternating. That matches.\n\nExample 3: The rectangle was below the horizontal stripe and to the right of the vertical stripe. The bottom rows had values at column 1. We used those values to fill horizontally. That matches.\n\nExample 4: The rectangle was below the horizontal stripe and to the right of the vertical stripe. The rectangle was split by a vertical stripe at column 6. The left side used bottom rows patterns; the right side used row's own column 6 values. That matches.\n\nThus, the rule seems consistent.\n\nNow, let's consider the test input. The rectangle is below horizontal stripe at row 1 and to the right of vertical stripe at column 0. The rectangle is rows 2-8, columns 1-9. Inside the rectangle, we have a vertical stripe at column 6 from rows 1-8. That vertical stripe splits the rectangle into left side columns 1-5 and right side columns 7-9. Column 5 is zero across all rows. So the rectangle is split into left side columns 1-4, column 5 zero, and right side columns 6-9. But we also need to consider column 6 as part of the right side. Column 6 has values 5 for rows 2-6, 5 for rows 7-8. So the vertical stripe at column 6 is inside the rectangle. But we treat column 6 as part of the right side. In example 4, we used the row's own value at column 6 for right side columns 6-9. But in test input, bottom rows have values at columns 6-9. So we will use bottom rows for right side columns 6-9. But we also have row's own value at column 6 which matches bottom rows' value. So it's fine.\n\nNow, we need to consider if we need to fill column 5 with something else. In example 4, column 5 remained zero. So we keep it zero.\n\nThus, the output grid we derived seems correct.\n\nBut we need to verify if there is any nuance about mapping rectangle rows to bottom rows for right side columns. In example 4, we used bottom rows for left side columns 1-4. For right side columns 6-9, we used row's own values. In test input, bottom rows have values for right side columns 6-9. So we will use bottom rows for right side columns 6-9. But we need to decide mapping. In example 2, we used mapping for entire row. In example 4, we used mapping only for left side columns. But we might also need to use mapping for right side columns. But we need to decide if we use mapping or row's own values. Since bottom rows have values for right side columns, we use mapping. But we also need to decide if we use mapping for all right side columns or just for columns 7-9. But bottom rows have values for columns 6-9. But we might use mapping for columns 6-9. But we need to decide if we should use mapping for column 6 as well. But bottom rows have 5 at column 6, which is same as row's own value. So it's fine.\n\nNow, we need to decide mapping for each rectangle row:\n\n- Row 2 -> bottom row 7\n- Row 3 -> bottom row 8\n- Row 4 -> bottom row 7\n- Row 5 -> bottom row 8\n- Row 6 -> bottom row 7\n\nNow, we need to check if there might be any other pattern for row 6: In example 4, row 6 used bottom row 8 for left side columns 1-4? Wait, example 4: row 6 left side columns 1-4 used row 8 pattern (2 2 2 2). So mapping row 6->row8. But in our mapping, row 6->row7. But we need to confirm mapping logic: In example 4, rectangle rows 1-6, bottom rows 7-8. The mapping was: row 1->row7, row 2->row8, row 3->row7, row 4->row8, row 5->row7, row 6->row8. That is, mapping alternates starting with row7 for row1. So for row 6, mapping is row8. That matches. In our test input, rectangle rows 2-6, bottom rows 7-8. So mapping should be: row2->row7, row3->row8, row4->row7, row5->row8, row6->row7? Wait, we need to check pattern: For rectangle rows 1-6, mapping is row1->row7, row2->row8, row3->row7, row4->row8, row5->row7, row6->row8. So the pattern is alternating starting with row7 for the first rectangle row. For our rectangle rows 2-6, we need to decide which is the first rectangle row. The first rectangle row is row 2. So mapping row2->row7, row3->row8, row4->row7, row5->row8, row6->row7? Wait, we need to maintain alternating pattern: row2->row7, row3->row8, row4->row7, row5->row8, row6->row7? But we need to check if row6 should map to row8 or row7. In the pattern above, row6->row8. But we have only 5 rectangle rows. The pattern would be row2->row7, row3->row8, row4->row7, row5->row8, row6->row7? Actually, if we alternate starting with row7 for row2, the pattern would be row2->row7, row3->row8, row4->row7, row5->row8, row6->row7. But we need to check if that matches the pattern in example 4. In example 4, row6->row8. But that was because row6 was the 6th rectangle row. In our case, we have 5 rectangle rows. So the pattern would end with row7. But is that consistent with the rule? The rule might be: For each rectangle row, choose the bottom row pattern that corresponds to that rectangle row's index modulo number of bottom rows. That is, mapping row index i (starting from 0) to bottom row index (i mod number of bottom rows). For example 4, rectangle rows 1-6, bottom rows 7-8. So i=0->row7, i=1->row8, i=2->row7, i=3->row8, i=4->row7, i=5->row8. That matches. For test input, rectangle rows 2-6, bottom rows 7-8. So i=0->row7, i=1->row8, i=2->row7, i=3->row8, i=4->row7. So mapping row6->row7. So we need to use row7 pattern for row6. That matches our earlier mapping. So we are consistent.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to apply mapping to left side columns 1-4 as well. In test input, bottom rows have zeros in columns 1-4. So we will use vertical stripe values. So mapping doesn't matter.\n\nThus, the output we derived is consistent.\n\nBut we need to check if there might be any other pattern that could produce a different output. For example, maybe we should fill left side columns 1-4 with the vertical stripe values repeated horizontally, but we might need to use bottom rows' values for some rows if they exist. But bottom rows have zeros. So it's fine.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill column 5 with something else. Column 5 is zero in all rows. So we keep zero.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 2 column 5 with something else. No.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 2 column 6-9 with bottom rows' values. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 2 column 6-9 with row's own values. But row's own values at column 6-9 are 5,0,0,0. But bottom rows have values 5,8,6,8. So we use bottom rows.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 2 column 6-9 with pattern from row7 or row8. We choose row7. So row 2: 5 8 6 8.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 3 column 6-9 with pattern from row8. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 4 column 6-9 with pattern from row7. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 5 column 6-9 with pattern from row8. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 6 column 6-9 with pattern from row7. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 7 and 8 unchanged. Yes.\n\nThus, final output is as we derived.\n\nBut we need to check if we need to fill column 0 for rows 2-6 with something else. In example 4, column 0 remained unchanged. So we keep it unchanged. That is 4,2,2,2,1.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 2 column 1-4 with 4. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 3 column 1-4 with 2. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 4 column 1-4 with 2. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 5 column 1-4 with 2. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 6 column 1-4 with 1. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 2 column 5 with 0. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 3 column 5 with 0. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 4 column 5 with 0. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 5 column 5 with 0. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 6 column 5 with 0. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 2 column 6 with 5. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 3 column 6 with 5. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 4 column 6 with 5. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 5 column 6 with 5. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 6 column 6 with 5. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 2 column 7 with 8. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 3 column 7 with 3. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 4 column 7 with 8. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 5 column 7 with 3. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 6 column 7 with 8. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 2 column 8 with 6. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 3 column 8 with 3. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 4 column 8 with 6. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 5 column 8 with 3. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 6 column 8 with 6. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 2 column 9 with 8. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 3 column 9 with 3. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 4 column 9 with 8. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 5 column 9 with 3. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if we need to fill row 6 column 9 with 8. Yes.\n\nThus, final output grid is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 2: 4 4 4 4 4 0 5 8 6 8\nRow 3: 2 2 2 2 2 0 5 3 3 3\nRow 4: 2 2 2 2 2 0 5 8 6 8\nRow 5: 2 2 2 2 2 0 5 3 3 3\nRow 6: 1 1 1 1 1 0 5 8 6 8\nRow 7: 0 0 ",
    "5": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to solve an ARC puzzle. We have three training examples with input and output grids. We need to deduce transformation rule(s) that map input to output. Then apply to test input.\n\nLet's analyze each example carefully.\n\nFirst, note that each grid is 10x10. Colors are numbers: 0 is background. Non-zero numbers represent shapes.\n\nWe need to find pattern.\n\nLet's parse Example 1.\n\nExample 1 Input grid:\n\nRow 0: 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 3 7 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 4 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 4 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 7 7 3 2 4 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 7 3 3 2 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 7 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput grid Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 3 7 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 2 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 7 4 2 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 3 3 7 4 2 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 3 7 7 4 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 3 0 0 4 4 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations: The shapes are rearranged. Let's identify the distinct colors in input: 4,2,3,7,? Actually there are numbers 4,2,3,7. In input, 4 appears at positions: (0,0), (1,6), (2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). Also maybe others? Wait row 0 col 0 is 4, row1 col 6 is 4, row2 col 6,7 are 4, row3 col 7 is 4, row4 col 7 is 4. So shape of 4 is like a cluster shape maybe like a \"L\" shape? Let's map coordinates: (0,0) is isolated? Actually 4 at (0,0) is separate from the cluster at (1,6) etc. Wait (0,0) is far away. So there are two separate clusters of color 4: one at (0,0) single cell, and another cluster at the right side.\n\nColor 2 appears at positions: (0,1), (3,6), (4,6), (6,6),(6,7). Also maybe (2,?) Actually row 2 col? Wait input row2 col? (2,? ) Let's check: row 2: 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 4 0 0. So 2 not there. row3: 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 4 0 0. So 2 at (3,6). row4: 0 0 0 7 7 3 2 4 0 0. So 2 at (4,6). row5: 0 0 0 7 3 3 2 0 0 0. So 2 at (5,6). row6: 0 0 0 7 0 0 2 2 0 0. So 2 at (6,6),(6,7). So cluster of 2's at bottom-right-ish. Also 2 at (0,1) single cell.\n\nColor 3 appears at positions: (1,1), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3). Wait check: row1 col1 is 7? Actually row1 col1 is 7. Wait row1 col1 is 7? Wait row1: 3 7 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0. So row1 col0 is 3, col1 is 7. So 3 at (1,0). Row2: 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 4 0 0. So 3 at (2,5). Row3: 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 4 0 0. So 3 at (3,5). Row4: 0 0 0 7 7 3 2 4 0 0. So 3 at (4,5). Row5: 0 0 0 7 3 3 2 0 0 0. So 3 at (5,4),(5,5). Row6: 0 0 0 7 0 0 2 2 0 0. So 3 not there. Row7: 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0. So 3 not there. So cluster of 3's: there is one at (1,0) single? Actually 3 at (1,0) isolated? Wait row1 col0 is 3, but also there are 3's at (2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5). So two clusters: one single at (1,0), one cluster near right side.\n\nColor 7 appears at positions: (1,1), (4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4). Also maybe others: row2 col? no. So cluster of 7's at bottom-left-ish.\n\nSo we have four colors: 2,3,4,7.\n\nNow look at output grid Example 1: Colors appear in different arrangement.\n\nLet's list coordinates for each color in output:\n\nColor 4: at (0,0), (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). So same cluster as input? Wait input cluster of 4 at right side had same coordinates: (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). Yes same. The single 4 at (0,0) also remains. So color 4 unchanged.\n\nColor 2: output coordinates: (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7) ??? Wait check output: row1 col6 is 2, row2 col5? Actually row2 col5 is 7? Wait we need to read output carefully.\n\nOutput Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 3 7 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 2 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 7 4 2 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 3 3 7 4 2 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 3 7 7 4 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 3 0 0 4 4 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: all zeros\nRow 9: all zeros\n\nLet's identify coordinates of color 2 in output:\n\n- (0,1) is 2\n- (1,6) is 2\n- (2,6) is 2\n- (2,7) is 2\n- (3,7) is 2\n- (4,7) is 2\n- (6,6)? Wait row6 col6 is 4? Actually row6 col6 is 4. So no 2 there.\n- (6,7) is 4? Actually row6 col7 is 4. So no 2.\n\nThus color 2 coordinates: (0,1),(1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). That's same cluster as input? Input had 2 at (0,1) single, and cluster at bottom-right: (3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7). Wait input cluster coordinates: (3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7). Output cluster coordinates: (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). That's shifted upward and right? Let's check differences.\n\nInput cluster of 2: coordinates:\n\n(3,6)\n(4,6)\n(5,6)\n(6,6)\n(6,7)\n\nThat's shape: a vertical line of 4 cells at column 6 rows 3-6, plus one cell at (6,7) to the right of bottom cell. So shape like a vertical line with a right extension at bottom.\n\nOutput cluster of 2: coordinates:\n\n(1,6)\n(2,6)\n(2,7)\n(3,7)\n(4,7)\n\nThis shape is like a vertical line of 3 cells at column 6 rows 1-2? Actually at (1,6),(2,6) vertical line of 2 cells, plus a horizontal line of 3 cells at row 2-4? Wait at (2,7),(3,7),(4,7) vertical line of 3 cells at column 7 rows 2-4. Combined shape: a vertical line of 2 at column 6, and vertical line of 3 at column 7, with a horizontal connection at (2,6)-(2,7). Actually shape looks like a \"\u0393\" shape rotated? Let's map: positions: (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). This is like a vertical line of 2 at column 6, a vertical line of 3 at column 7, and one connecting cell at (2,6)-(2,7). So shape like a \"corner\" shape with 5 cells: two vertical lines of lengths 2 and 3, sharing a corner at (2,6). Input shape had vertical line of 4 at column 6 rows 3-6, and one cell at (6,7). That's also a corner shape but rotated? Actually input shape: vertical line of 4 at column 6 rows 3-6, plus a cell at (6,7) to the right of bottom cell. So shape: vertical line of 4, plus right extension at bottom. Output shape: vertical line of 2 at column 6 rows 1-2, plus vertical line of 3 at column 7 rows 2-4. So shape is rotated 90 degrees? Let's think.\n\nInput shape orientation: vertical line of 4 at column 6, extension to the right at bottom. So shape is like an \"L\" shape rotated 180? Actually \"L\" shape with vertical leg of length 4 and horizontal leg of length 1 at bottom. Output shape orientation: vertical line of 2 at column 6, extension downward at right? Wait output shape: vertical line of 2 at column 6 rows 1-2, extension downward at column 7 rows 2-4. So shape is like a rotated \"L\" shape: vertical leg of length 2 at left, horizontal leg of length 3 at right? Wait vertical leg of length 2 at left, horizontal leg of length 3 at right? Actually the horizontal leg is vertical line of 3 at column 7. So shape is like a \"\u0393\" shape with vertical leg at column 6 of length 2, horizontal leg at column 7 of length 3. That's also an \"L\" shape rotated 90 degrees clockwise relative to input? Let's examine orientation: Input L shape: vertical leg of 4 at column 6, horizontal leg of 1 at bottom to right. Output L shape: vertical leg of 2 at column 6, horizontal leg of 3 at right. So both shapes are L shapes but with different leg lengths. The orientation is the same? Let's check orientation: In input, vertical leg is at column 6, horizontal leg extends to right at bottom row 6. In output, vertical leg is at column 6, horizontal leg extends to right at row 2? Wait horizontal leg at column 7 rows 2-4 is vertical, not horizontal. Actually horizontal leg of L shape is horizontal line of cells. But here we have vertical line at column 7. So shape is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise? Let's consider shape orientation: Input shape has vertical leg (long) at column 6, horizontal leg (short) at row 6 column 7. So orientation: vertical leg up-down, horizontal leg rightwards at bottom. Output shape has vertical leg at column 6 rows 1-2, horizontal leg? Actually we have vertical leg at column 7 rows 2-4. That's vertical leg as well. So shape is like a rotated 90 degrees? Let's think: If we rotate input shape 90 degrees clockwise, vertical leg becomes horizontal leg, horizontal leg becomes vertical leg. But output shape has vertical leg at column 6 rows 1-2 and vertical leg at column 7 rows 2-4. That is not a simple rotation. Wait maybe shape is not rotated but mirrored? Let's examine coordinates relative to a bounding box.\n\nInput cluster bounding box: min row=3, max row=6, min col=6, max col=7. So bounding box size: height=4 (rows 3-6 inclusive), width=2 (cols 6-7). So shape is a 4x2 rectangle minus one cell? Actually there are 5 cells. The shape is like a 4x2 rectangle missing one cell at (3,7). Wait check: coordinates: (3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7). So rectangle of 4x2 would be cells at rows 3-6, cols 6-7. That would have 8 cells. We have only 5, missing cells at (3,7),(4,7),(5,7). So shape is like a vertical line of 4 at col 6, plus one cell at bottom right.\n\nOutput cluster bounding box: min row=1, max row=4, min col=6, max col=7. So height=4, width=2. Coordinates: (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). So shape is like vertical line of 2 at col 6 (rows 1-2), vertical line of 3 at col 7 (rows 2-4). So shape is like a vertical line of 2 at left, vertical line of 3 at right, sharing a cell at (2,6)-(2,7). This shape is like a \"\u0393\" shape but with vertical legs. The shape is basically a rotated 90 degrees of the input shape? Let's rotate input shape 90 degrees counterclockwise: input coordinates relative to bounding box: relative positions: (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(3,1). Rotating 90 ccw: (0,0)->(0,3)? Wait we need to compute transformation: For a shape of size HxW, coordinates (r,c) transform to (W-1-c, r). For H=4, W=2. So input shape coordinates relative to bounding box top-left (3,6). Let's compute relative positions: (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(3,1). Rotating 90 ccw: (0,0)->(1,0)? Wait W-1-c: W-1=1. So (0,0) -> (1,0). (1,0)->(1,1). (2,0)->(1,2). (3,0)->(1,3). (3,1)->(0,3). So rotated shape relative coordinates: (1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(0,3). That's a horizontal line of 4 at row 1, plus one cell at (0,3). That shape is horizontal line of 4 at row 1, plus one cell at top right. That's not the output shape.\n\nRotating 90 clockwise: (r,c)->(c, H-1-r). For H=4,W=2. So (0,0)->(0,3). (1,0)->(0,2). (2,0)->(0,1). (3,0)->(0,0). (3,1)->(1,0). So rotated shape relative coordinates: (0,3),(0,2),(0,1),(0,0),(1,0). That's horizontal line of 4 at row 0, plus one cell at (1,0). That shape is horizontal line of 4 at top, plus one cell below leftmost. That is not output shape either.\n\nMirroring horizontally (flip across vertical axis): (r,c)->(r, W-1-c). For W=2: (0,0)->(0,1). (1,0)->(1,1). (2,0)->(2,1). (3,0)->(3,1). (3,1)->(3,0). So shape relative coordinates: (0,1),(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(3,0). That's vertical line of 4 at col 1, plus one cell at bottom left. That shape is vertical line of 4 at col 1, plus one cell at (3,0). Not output shape.\n\nMirroring vertically (flip across horizontal axis): (r,c)->(H-1-r,c). For H=4: (0,0)->(3,0). (1,0)->(2,0). (2,0)->(1,0). (3,0)->(0,0). (3,1)->(0,1). So shape relative coordinates: (3,0),(2,0),(1,0),(0,0),(0,1). That's vertical line of 4 at col 0, plus one cell at top right. Not output shape.\n\nSo output shape is not a simple rotation or reflection of input shape. But maybe the transformation rule is something else: maybe the shapes of each color are rearranged to a new configuration relative to a central pivot or something.\n\nLet's examine other colors.\n\nColor 3 in input: coordinates: (1,0),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5). Output coordinates: (1,0),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5)? Wait output grid: Let's list coordinates for color 3 in output:\n\nRow 0: none\nRow 1: (1,0) is 3\nRow 2: (2,5) is 7? Wait row2 col5 is 7? Actually row2 col5 is 7 in output. Wait row2 col5 is 7. So 3 not there. Row2 col? Let's check output row2: 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 2 0 0. So 3 not there. Row3: 0 0 0 0 0 7 4 2 0 0. So 3 not there. Row4: 0 0 0 3 3 7 4 2 0 0. So 3 at (4,3),(4,4). Row5: 0 0 0 3 7 7 4 0 0 0. So 3 at (5,3). Row6: 0 0 0 3 0 0 4 4 0 0. So 3 at (6,3). Row7: 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. So 3 at (7,3),(7,4). So cluster of 3's in output: positions (1,0),(4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4). Wait also maybe (5,3) is 3. Yes.\n\nInput cluster of 3's: (1,0) single, and cluster at (2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5). So output cluster of 3's: (1,0) remains same, but cluster at (4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4). This cluster shape is different: it's like a vertical line of 3 at col 3 rows 4-6 plus horizontal line at row 4-7? Let's map: coordinates: (4,3),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3) vertical line of 4 at col 3 rows 4-7. Additional cells at (4,4),(7,4). That's horizontal line of 2 at row 4-7? Actually at (4,4) and (7,4). So shape: vertical line of 4 at col 3, plus two cells at right side at top and bottom. So shape is like a vertical line of 4 with two side cells at top and bottom. Input shape had vertical line of 2 at col 5 rows 2-3? Actually input cluster: (2,5),(3,5),(4,5) vertical line of 3 at col 5 rows 2-4, plus two cells at (5,4),(5,5) below? Wait input cluster: (5,4),(5,5) at row 5 col 4-5. So shape: vertical line of 3 at col 5 rows 2-4, plus two cells at bottom row 5 columns 4-5. So shape is vertical line of 3 plus horizontal line of 2 at bottom. Output shape: vertical line of 4 at col 3 rows 4-7, plus two cells at top and bottom of that vertical line: at (4,4),(7,4). So shape rotated 90 degrees? Let's check: Input shape: vertical line of 3 at col 5 rows 2-4, horizontal line of 2 at row 5 columns 4-5. Output shape: vertical line of 4 at col 3 rows 4-7, horizontal line of 2 at column 4 at rows 4 and 7 (top and bottom). So shape rotated 90 degrees? Let's examine orientation: Input shape: vertical leg of length 3, horizontal leg of length 2 at bottom. Output shape: vertical leg of length 4, horizontal leg of length 2 at top and bottom? Wait horizontal leg of 2 at row 4 col 4 and row 7 col 4. That's two cells on the same column, not horizontal. Actually horizontal leg would be cells at same row but different columns. But output horizontal cells are at same column (col 4) but different rows (4 and 7). So that's vertical, not horizontal. So output shape has vertical leg of 4, and two side cells at top and bottom. That shape is like a vertical line of 4 with side cells at top and bottom, like a vertical \"T\" shape but with two side cells? Wait shape: vertical line of 4 at col 3 rows 4-7. Additional cells at (4,4),(7,4). That's like vertical line of 4 with side cells at top and bottom at right side. That's like a \"\u0393\" shape rotated 180? Actually input shape had vertical line of 3 at col 5 rows 2-4, plus horizontal line of 2 at bottom row 5 columns 4-5. That's like a \"\u0393\" shape with vertical leg of 3 and horizontal leg of 2 at bottom. Output shape has vertical leg of 4 at col 3 rows 4-7, plus two cells at top and bottom at right side. That's like a \"\u0393\" shape with vertical leg of 4 and horizontal leg of 2 at top? Wait horizontal leg at top would be cells at row 4 columns 4-5. But output has only cell at (4,4). So not exactly.\n\nThus shapes of colors changed orientation or arrangement.\n\nLet's analyze color 7.\n\nInput color 7 coordinates: (1,1),(4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4). Output coordinates: (1,1),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5),(6,5),(7,5),(7,6). Wait check output grid: row1 col1 is 7, row4 col5 is 7? Let's read output row4: 0 0 0 3 3 7 4 2 0 0. So row4 col5 is 7. Row5: 0 0 0 3 7 7 4 0 0 0. So row5 col4 is 7, row5 col5 is 7. Row6: 0 0 0 3 0 0 4 4 0 0. So row6 col? Actually row6 col5 is 0. Wait row6 col5 is 0. So maybe 7 at row6 col? Let's check output row6: 0 0 0 3 0 0 4 4 0 0. So 7 not there. Row7: 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. So 7 not there. So output 7 coordinates: (1,1),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5). That's only four cells. Wait we might have missed something: output row5 col? Actually row5 col4 is 7, row5 col5 is 7. So yes. Row4 col5 is 7. So 7 cluster in output: (1,1),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5). That's 4 cells. But input cluster had 7 cells. So some 7 cells disappeared? Wait maybe we misread output grid. Let's re-read output Example 1:\n\n```\n4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 7 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 4 2 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 7 4 2 0 0\n0 0 0 3 7 7 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nLet's parse each row:\n\nRow0: 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 3 7 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 2 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0 7 4 2 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 3 3 7 4 2 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 3 7 7 4 0 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 3 0 0 4 4 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\nRow8: all zeros\nRow9: all zeros\n\nSo color 7 coordinates in output:\n\n- (1,1)\n- (2,5)\n- (3,5)\n- (4,5)\n- (5,3)\n- (5,4)\n- (5,5)\n- (6,3)\n- (7,3)\n- (7,4)\n\nWait I mis-read earlier. Let's list all positions where value is 7:\n\nRow1 col1: 7\nRow2 col5: 7\nRow3 col5: 7\nRow4 col5: 7\nRow5 col3: 7\nRow5 col4: 7\nRow5 col5: 7\nRow6 col3: 7\nRow7 col3: 7\nRow7 col4: 7\n\nSo there are 10 cells of color 7 in output. Input had 7 cells. So some 7 cells moved or new 7 cells added? Wait input had 7 cells: (1,1),(4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4). Output has 10 cells. So new 7 cells appear at (2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4). Actually (5,3) and (6,3) and (7,3) existed in input? Input had (5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4). Yes those exist. So new cells: (2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,4). And (4,3),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4) existed. So additional 7 cells appear at (2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,4). So shape of 7's changed: moved into a vertical line at col 5 rows 2-4, plus a horizontal line at row 5 col 4-5? Actually (5,4) is part of horizontal line at row 5 columns 4-5. So shape is like vertical line of 3 at col 5 rows 2-4, plus horizontal line of 2 at row 5 columns 4-5, plus vertical line of 3 at col 3 rows 5-7? Wait we also have vertical line at col 3 rows 5-7: (5,3),(6,3),(7,3). So shape of 7's in output is like a \"T\" shape: vertical line of 3 at col 5 rows 2-4, horizontal line of 2 at row 5 col 4-5, vertical line of 3 at col 3 rows 5-7. That's like a \"T\" shape with a vertical stem at left and right? Actually it's like a vertical line at col 3 rows 5-7, vertical line at col 5 rows 2-4, plus horizontal line connecting them at (5,4)-(5,5). So shape is like a \"plus\" shape but offset: vertical lines at col 3 and col 5, horizontal line at row 5 connecting them. So shape is a \"cross\" shape but missing the top vertical line at col 3 above row 5? Actually vertical line at col 3 is from row5-7. No top part above row5. Vertical line at col 5 is from row2-4. So shape is like two vertical lines separated by 2 rows, connected by a horizontal line at row5 between them. So shape is like a \"U\" shape? Wait let's visualize: coordinates:\n\n(2,5)\n(3,5)\n(4,5)\n(5,4)\n(5,5)\n(5,3)\n(6,3)\n(7,3)\n(7,4)\n\nWait we also have (7,4) as 7? Yes row7 col4 is 7. So shape includes (7,4). So vertical line at col 3: (5,3),(6,3),(7,3). Horizontal line at row 5: (5,4),(5,5). Vertical line at col 5: (2,5),(3,5),(4,5). And additional cell at (7,4). That is like a vertical line at col 5 above, vertical line at col 3 below, horizontal line at row 5 connecting them, plus a bottom cell at (7,4). So shape is like a \"T\" shape with extra cell at bottom? Not exactly.\n\nLet's check input shape of 7: coordinates: (1,1),(4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4). That shape is like vertical line at col 3 rows 4-7 plus horizontal line at row 4 columns 3-4 plus a single at (1,1). So shape is like a vertical line at col 3 rows 4-7, horizontal line at row 4 col 3-4, plus a separate cell at (1,1). So input shape had a \"T\" shape but with vertical line at col3 and horizontal line at row4, plus separate cell at (1,1). Output shape has vertical line at col5 rows 2-4, horizontal line at row5 col4-5, vertical line at col3 rows5-7, plus a cell at (7,4). So shape is like a \"T\" shape but vertical lines at col3 and col5, horizontal line at row5 connecting them, plus a cell at (7,4). So it's like shape changed orientation and also gained extra cells.\n\nIt seems the transformation may involve moving each shape to a new location based on some rule like aligning to a central axis or to a reference shape.\n\nLet's also examine Example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n\nRow0: 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 2 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 3 3 3 3 1 8 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 3 3 2 0 8 8 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 8 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\nRow9: all zeros\n\nOutput Example 2:\n\nRow0: 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 2 8 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 1 1 1 1 3 2 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 1 1 8 0 2 2 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 0 8 0 2 2 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\nRow9: all zeros\n\nLet's identify colors: 1,2,3,8. In input, we have:\n\nColor 1: positions: (0,0),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6),(5,? Actually row5 col? 5? Wait row5: 0 0 3 3 2 0 8 8 0 0. So 1 not there. Row6: 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 8 0 0. So 1 not there. So 1 cluster includes (0,0),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6). That's shape of 1's.\n\nColor 2: positions: (1,1),(4,4),(5,4),(6,4),(7,4),(8,4). That's vertical line of 6 at column 4 rows 1-8? Wait check: row1 col1 is 8? Actually row1: 2 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. So 2 at (1,0). Wait row1 col0 is 2. So 2 at (1,0). Row4 col4? Wait row4: 0 0 3 3 3 3 1 8 0 0. So 2 not there. Wait row5: 0 0 3 3 2 0 8 8 0 0. So 2 at (5,4). Row6: 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 8 0 0. So 2 at (6,4). Row7: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. So 2 at (7,4). Row8: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. So 2 at (8,4). So vertical line of 5 at column 4 rows 5-8 plus single at (1,0). So shape of 2: one isolated at (1,0), vertical line of 5 at column 4 rows 5-8.\n\nColor 3: positions: (0,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,2),(5,3). Wait row5 col2=3, row5 col3=3. Also maybe others: row2 and row3? Wait row2: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0. So 3 not there. Row3 same. Row4: 0 0 3 3 3 3 1 8 0 0. So 3 at (4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5). Row5: 0 0 3 3 2 0 8 8 0 0. So 3 at (5,2),(5,3). So cluster of 3: shape like 4 cells in a row at row4 col2-5 plus 2 cells below at row5 col2-3. So shape of 3 is like a 4x2 rectangle missing two cells at bottom right? Actually rectangle of 4x2 would be rows 4-5, cols 2-5. That would have 8 cells. We have 6 cells: missing cells at (5,4),(5,5). So shape is like a 4x2 rectangle missing bottom right 2 cells. So shape is like a 4x2 rectangle with missing bottom right.\n\nColor 8: positions: (1,1),(4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7). Wait row1 col1 is 8? Actually row1: 2 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. So 8 at (1,1). Row4: 0 0 3 3 3 3 1 8 0 0. So 8 at (4,7). Row5: 0 0 3 3 2 0 8 8 0 0. So 8 at (5,6),(5,7). Row6: 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 8 0 0. So 8 at (6,6),(6,7). So cluster of 8: vertical line of 2 at col6 rows5-6, horizontal line of 2 at row5 col6-7, horizontal line of 2 at row6 col6-7, plus single at (1,1). So shape is like a 2x2 square at bottom right plus isolated at (1,1).\n\nNow output Example 2:\n\nRow0: 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 2 8 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 1 1 1 1 3 2 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 1 1 8 0 2 2 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 0 8 0 2 2 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\nRow9: all zeros\n\nLet's identify coordinates for each color in output.\n\nColor 1: positions: (0,0),(1,6),(2,? Wait row2 col? row2 col? Actually row2 col? row2: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0. So 1 not there. Row3: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0. So 1 not there. Row4: 0 0 1 1 1 1 3 2 0 0. So 1 at (4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5). Row5: 0 0 1 1 8 0 2 2 0 0. So 1 at (5,2),(5,3). So cluster of 1: shape like 4 cells in a row at row4 col2-5, plus 2 cells below at row5 col2-3. That's like shape of 1 in input: 4 cells in a row at row4 col2-5? Wait input shape of 1 had 4 cells in a row at row4? Actually input shape of 1 had 4 cells in a row at row4 col6? Wait input had 1 at (4,6) only? Actually input shape of 1: (0,0),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6). That's shape of 1: 4 cells in a vertical line at col6 rows2-3? Wait we need to re-evaluate.\n\nHold on: Input shape of 1: Let's list coordinates again:\n\n- (0,0)\n- (1,6)\n- (2,4),(2,5),(2,6)\n- (3,4),(3,5),(3,6)\n- (4,6)\n\nSo shape of 1 is like a \"T\" shape? Actually it's like a vertical line at col6 rows1-4 plus horizontal line at row2-3 col4-6? Let's map: row2 col4-6: 3 cells; row3 col4-6: 3 cells; vertical line at col6 rows1-4: 4 cells (including (1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(4,6)). And single at (0,0). So shape is like a vertical line at col6 plus a 3x2 rectangle at rows2-3 col4-6, plus a single at (0,0). So shape is complex.\n\nOutput shape of 1: cluster at (4,2)-(4,5) plus (5,2)-(5,3). So shape is like 4 cells in a row at row4 col2-5, plus 2 cells below at row5 col2-3. That's a 2x4 rectangle missing bottom right 2 cells? Actually rectangle of 4x2 would be rows4-5, cols2-5. That would have 8 cells. We have 6 cells: missing bottom right 2 cells at (5,4),(5,5). So shape is like a 4x2 rectangle missing bottom right 2 cells. That's the same shape as color 3 in input? Wait color 3 in input had shape of 6 cells: 4 cells in a row at row4 col2-5, plus 2 cells below at row5 col2-3. Yes exactly same shape. So color 1 in output has shape identical to shape of color 3 in input. Interesting.\n\nSimilarly, color 3 in output: positions: (0,1),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6),(5,? Wait row5 col? row5 col? Actually row5 col? Row5: 0 0 1 1 8 0 2 2 0 0. So 3 not there. Row4: 0 0 1 1 1 1 3 2 0 0. So 3 at (4,6). Row5: 0 0 1 1 8 0 2 2 0 0. So 3 not there. Row6: 0 0 0 0 8 0 2 2 0 0. So 3 not there. So color 3 positions: (0,1),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6). That's 8 cells. That's shape of 3 in input? Input shape of 3 had 6 cells. But output shape of 3 has 8 cells: 4 cells in a row at row2-3 col4-6, plus vertical line at col6 rows2-4? Actually output shape of 3: row2 col4-6: 3 cells; row3 col4-6: 3 cells; row4 col6: 1 cell; row0 col1: 1 cell. So shape: vertical line at col6 rows2-4 (3 cells), horizontal line at row2-3 col4-6 (6 cells?), plus single at (0,1). That shape is like a vertical line at col6 with horizontal arms at row2-3, plus a single at (0,1). That is similar to shape of 8 in input? Let's check input shape of 8: positions: (1,1),(4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7). That's vertical line at col6 rows5-6 (2 cells) plus horizontal line at row5 col6-7 (2 cells), plus horizontal line at row6 col6-7 (2 cells), plus single at (1,1). So shape of 8 in input is like a 2x2 square at bottom right plus single at (1,1). Output shape of 3 is like a vertical line of 3 at col6 rows2-4 plus horizontal line at row2-3 col4-6, plus single at (0,1). So shape of 3 in output is like shape of 8 in input but extended? Wait shape of 8 in input had vertical line of 2 at col6 rows5-6, horizontal lines at row5 and row6 col6-7. So shape of 8 in input is like a 2x2 square plus a single at (1,1). Output shape of 3 is like vertical line of 3 at col6 rows2-4, horizontal line at row2-3 col4-6, plus single at (0,1). That's like shape of 8 in input but with an extra cell at top of vertical line? Actually vertical line of 3 vs 2. And horizontal line at row2-3 vs row5-6. So shape is similar but shifted upward by 3 rows? Wait 8 input vertical line at col6 rows5-6, horizontal lines at row5-6. Output 3 vertical line at col6 rows2-4, horizontal lines at row2-3. So vertical line extended upward by 3 rows. Horizontal lines moved up by 3 rows. Single at (0,1) is also moved up by 3 rows relative to (1,1). So shape of 3 in output is like shape of 8 in input but moved up 3 rows. Similarly, shape of 1 in output is like shape of 3 in input moved up? Let's check: shape of 3 in input: horizontal line at row4 col2-5, vertical line at col2-3 at row5? Actually shape of 3 input: 4 cells in row4 col2-5, 2 cells below at row5 col2-3. Output shape of 1: same shape. So shape of 1 output is shape of 3 input. Similarly, shape of 2 output: positions: (1,0),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7),(7,? Actually row7 col? Row7: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0. So 2 not there. Row8: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0. So 2 not there. So 2 output: (1,0),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7). Wait we also have 2 at (5,? Actually row5 col? row5: 0 0 1 1 8 0 2 2 0 0. So 2 at (5,6),(5,7). Row6: 0 0 0 0 8 0 2 2 0 0. So 2 at (6,6),(6,7). Row1: 2 8 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So 2 at (1,0). So 2 output shape: vertical line at col6 rows5-6 (2 cells), horizontal line at row5 col6-7 (2 cells), horizontal line at row6 col6-7 (2 cells), plus single at (1,0). That's shape of 8 input? Wait shape of 8 input: 2x2 square at bottom right plus single at (1,1). Output shape of 2: same shape but with single at (1,0) instead of (1,1). Actually shape of 8 input had single at (1,1). Output shape of 2 has single at (1,0). So shape of 2 output is like shape of 8 input but with single moved left by 1 column. But shape of 8 input had 2x2 square at bottom right, same as shape of 2 output. So shape of 2 output is shape of 8 input but with single at (1,0). Wait shape of 8 input had single at (1,1). So difference is horizontal shift of 1 left. So maybe the rule is that each color's shape is moved to a new location relative to some reference point, maybe aligning to a particular coordinate or to the shape of another color.\n\nLet's analyze Example 3.\n\nExample 3 Input:\n\nRow0: 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 7 6 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 0 7 9 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0 7 4 0 0 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 6 6 7 0 0 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 7 6 6 0 0 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow8: all zeros\nRow9: all zeros\n\nOutput Example 3:\n\nRow0: 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 7 6 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 0 6 4 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0 6 9 0 0 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 7 7 6 0 0 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 6 7 7 0 0 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow8: all zeros\nRow9: all zeros\n\nColors: 9,4,7,6. Input shapes:\n\nColor 9: positions: (0,1),(1,5),(1,6),(2,6). Also maybe (??). So shape of 9: single at (0,1), plus cluster at (1,5),(1,6),(2,6). That's like a vertical line of 2 at col6 rows1-2, plus horizontal line at row1 col5-6. So shape like a small \"L\".\n\nColor 4: positions: (0,1)? Wait row0 col1 is 4? Actually row0 col1 is 4. Yes. Row3 col5 is 4. Row4 col5 is 4. So 4 at (0,1),(3,5),(4,5). So 3 cells.\n\nColor 7: positions: (1,0),(2,5),(4,4),(5,5),(6,3),(6,4). Wait check: row1 col0 is 7. Row2 col5 is 7. Row4 col4 is 7. Row5 col5 is 7. Row6 col3 is 7. Row6 col4 is 7. So 6 cells.\n\nColor 6: positions: (1,1),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). Wait check: row1 col1 is 6. Row5 col3 is 6, col4 is 6. Row6 col4 is 6, col5 is 6. So 5 cells.\n\nNow output shapes:\n\nColor 9: positions: (0,1),(1,5),(1,6),(2,6). Wait output row0 col1 is 9, row1 col5 is 9? Actually row1 col5 is 4? Wait row1 col5 is 4? Let's read output row1: 7 6 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0. So 9 not there. Let's list output coordinates:\n\nRow0: 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 7 6 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 0 6 4 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0 6 9 0 0 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 7 7 6 0 0 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 6 7 7 0 0 0 0\n\nSo color 9 positions: (0,1),(3,5),(4,5). Actually row3 col5 is 9, row4 col5 is 9. So 9 at (0,1),(3,5),(4,5). That's 3 cells. Input had 4 cells. So some 9 cells moved or removed. Let's check all 9 positions in output: (0,1),(3,5),(4,5). So 3 cells. Input had 4 cells: (0,1),(1,5),(1,6),(2,6). So output shape is like vertical line at col5 rows3-4, plus single at (0,1). That's shape of 4 in input? Wait 4 in input had 3 cells: (0,1),(3,5),(4,5). Yes exactly same shape as 9 output. So color 9 output shape matches color 4 input shape.\n\nColor 4 in output: positions: (0,1),(1,5),(1,6),(2,6). Wait row0 col1 is 9? Actually row0 col1 is 9. So 4 not at (0,1). Let's list output 4's: Row0 col1 is 9, so 4 not there. Row1 col5 is 4, col6 is 4. Row2 col6 is 4. So 4 positions: (1,5),(1,6),(2,6). That's 3 cells. Input 4 had 3 cells: (0,1),(3,5),(4,5). So 4 output shape matches 9 input shape? Wait 9 input shape had 4 cells: (0,1),(1,5),(1,6),(2,6). So 4 output shape matches 9 input shape minus one cell? Actually 9 input had 4 cells; 4 output has 3 cells. But maybe 4 output shape matches 9 input shape minus one cell? Let's check: 9 input shape: (0,1),(1,5),(1,6),(2,6). 4 output shape: (1,5),(1,6),(2,6). So missing (0,1). So shape of 4 output is like shape of 9 input minus the single at (0,1). So maybe some cells removed? Let's hold.\n\nColor 6 in output: positions: (1,1),(2,5),(3,? Actually row3 col? row3 col? Let's list: Row1 col1 is 6. Row2 col5 is 6. Row4 col4 is 6. Row5 col5 is 6. Row6 col3 is 6. So 6 positions: (1,1),(2,5),(4,4),(5,5),(6,3). That's 5 cells. Input 6 had 5 cells: (1,1),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). So shape of 6 output matches shape of 6 input but moved? Wait compare coordinates: Input 6 cluster: (1,1),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). Output 6 cluster: (1,1),(2,5),(4,4),(5,5),(6,3). So shape rotated or mirrored? Let's analyze.\n\nColor 7 in output: positions: (1,0),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). Wait row1 col0 is 7. Row5 col3 is 7, row5 col4 is 7, row6 col4 is 7, row6 col5 is 7. That's 5 cells. Input 7 had 6 cells: (1,0),(2,5),(4,4),(5,5),(6,3),(6,4). Output 7 cluster: (1,0),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). So shape changed: missing (2,5) and (4,4),(5,5)? Wait output has (5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). Input had (2,5),(4,4),(5,5),(6,3),(6,4). So output cluster is like a 2x2 square at bottom right (5,3)-(6,4) plus horizontal line at row6 col4-5? Wait we have (6,4),(6,5) horizontal. And vertical line at col4 rows5-6? Actually (5,4),(6,4). So shape of 7 output is like a 2x2 square at (5,3),(5,4),(6,3),(6,4) plus extra cell at (6,5). So shape is like a 2x2 square plus one extra cell to the right of bottom row? Actually bottom right cell (6,5). So shape of 7 output is like a 3x2 rectangle missing top right? Wait 2x2 square plus one cell to the right of bottom row. So shape of 7 output maybe matches shape of 6 input? Let's check shape of 6 input: (1,1),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). That's exactly same coordinates as output 7 cluster: (1,1),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). Wait input 6 had those coordinates? Yes input 6 had (1,1),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). So output 7 cluster matches input 6 shape exactly. So color 7 output shape is same as input 6 shape.\n\nSimilarly, output 6 cluster maybe matches input 7 shape? Let's check: Input 7 had coordinates: (1,0),(2,5),(4,4),(5,5),(6,3),(6,4). Output 6 cluster: (1,1),(2,5),(4,4),(5,5),(6,3). That's almost same as input 7 but with (1,0) replaced by (1,1). So shape of output 6 is input 7 shape but with the single moved right by 1 column. So there's a pattern: each color's output shape is the shape of some other color's input shape, possibly with a shift.\n\nLet's examine mapping between colors across examples:\n\nExample 1 mapping:\n\n- Color 4 output shape same as input 4 shape. So 4 maps to itself.\n\n- Color 2 output shape seems to be shape of 3 input? Let's check: Input 3 shape coordinates: (1,0),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5). That's shape of 3. Output 2 shape coordinates: (0,1),(1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). Not same. So maybe 2 output shape is shape of 7 input? Let's check input 7 shape: (1,1),(4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4). That's 7 cells. Output 2 shape has 6 cells. So not same.\n\nMaybe each color's output shape is the shape of another color but rotated or mirrored.\n\nLet's examine mapping for each color in Example 1:\n\nInput shapes:\n\n- Color 4: shape S4\n- Color 2: shape S2\n- Color 3: shape S3\n- Color 7: shape S7\n\nOutput shapes:\n\n- Color 4: shape S4 (unchanged)\n- Color 2: shape S2'? Actually shape S2 output may be shape S3 rotated? Let's check.\n\nLet's compute shape S3: coordinates: (1,0),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5). That shape has bounding box rows 1-5, cols 0-5. But shape S2 output: coordinates: (0,1),(1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). That's bounding box rows 0-4, cols 1-7. So shape S2 output is not same as S3. So maybe S2 output shape is shape S7 rotated or mirrored? Let's check shape S7 input: coordinates: (1,1),(4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4). That shape bounding box rows 1-7, cols 1-4. S2 output bounding box rows 0-4, cols 1-7. So shape S2 output is not S7 either.\n\nLet's examine shape S3 input: shape of 3: maybe output shape of 2 is shape of 3 rotated 90 degrees? Let's compute shape S3 rotated 90 degrees clockwise: relative coordinates (r,c)->(c, H-1-r). Input shape S3 bounding box height=5, width=6. Let's compute relative coordinates: (0,0),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(4,4),(4,5). Rotating 90 clockwise: (0,0)->(0,4), (1,5)->(5,3), (2,5)->(5,2), (3,5)->(5,1), (4,4)->(4,0), (4,5)->(5,0). That yields coordinates: (0,4),(5,3),(5,2),(5,1),(4,0),(5,0). That shape is a vertical line at row5 col0-5? Actually coordinates: (5,0),(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,? Wait we have (5,0),(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,? There's also (0,4) and (4,0). So shape: horizontal line at row5 col0-3, plus cell at (4,0) and (0,4). That's not S2 output shape.\n\nMaybe shape S3 rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise: (r,c)->(W-1-c, r). Compute: (0,0)->(5,0), (1,5)->(0,1), (2,5)->(0,2), (3,5)->(0,3), (4,4)->(1,4), (4,5)->(0,4). That yields coordinates: (5,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,4),(0,4). That shape: horizontal line at row0 col1-4, plus cell at (1,4) and (5,0). Not S2 output shape.\n\nMaybe shape S3 mirrored horizontally: (r,c)->(r, W-1-c). For W=6: (0,0)->(0,5),(1,5)->(1,0),(2,5)->(2,0),(3,5)->(3,0),(4,4)->(4,1),(4,5)->(4,0). That yields coordinates: (0,5),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(4,1),(4,0). Not S2 output shape.\n\nMirrored vertically: (H-1-r,c). For H=5: (0,0)->(4,0),(1,5)->(3,5),(2,5)->(2,5),(3,5)->(1,5),(4,4)->(0,4),(4,5)->(0,5). That yields coordinates: (4,0),(3,5),(2,5),(1,5),(0,4),(0,5). Not S2 output shape.\n\nSo S2 output shape is not a simple transform of S3 shape. Let's examine shape S2 input: coordinates: (0,1),(3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7). That shape bounding box rows 0-6, cols 1-7. S2 output shape: (0,1),(1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). That bounding box rows 0-4, cols 1-7. So shape S2 output is like shape S2 input but truncated: missing cells at (3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7)? Wait input had cells at (3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7). Output has cells at (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). So shape changed orientation: vertical line at col6 rows1-2, vertical line at col7 rows2-4. So shape S2 output is like shape S2 input rotated 90 degrees? Let's test: Input S2 bounding box height=7, width=7? Actually bounding box rows 0-6, cols 1-7: height 7, width 7. But shape S2 input: cells at (0,1) (top left), (3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7). That shape looks like a vertical line at col6 rows3-6, plus cell at (6,7) to the right, plus single at (0,1). Output shape: vertical line at col6 rows1-2, vertical line at col7 rows2-4. So shape S2 output is like shape S2 input rotated 90 degrees clockwise? Let's test: Rotating input shape 90 clockwise: For each cell (r,c) relative to bounding box top-left (0,1). Let's compute relative coordinates: (0,0),(3,5),(4,5),(5,5),(6,5),(6,6). Rotating 90 clockwise: (r,c)->(c, H-1-r). Here H=7, W=7. Compute: (0,0)->(0,6). (3,5)->(5,3). (4,5)->(5,2). (5,5)->(5,1). (6,5)->(5,0). (6,6)->(6,0). So rotated shape coordinates: (0,6),(5,3),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0),(6,0). That's vertical line at column 5 rows5-6? Wait coordinates: (5,0),(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,? Actually we have (5,0),(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(6,0),(0,6). So shape is vertical line at row5 col0-3, plus cell at (6,0), plus cell at (0,6). Not S2 output shape.\n\nMaybe shape S2 output is shape S2 input rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise? Let's compute: (r,c)->(W-1-c, r). For H=7, W=7: (0,0)->(6,0). (3,5)->(1,3). (4,5)->(1,4). (5,5)->(1,5). (6,5)->(1,6). (6,6)->(0,6). So rotated shape: (6,0),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(0,6). That's vertical line at row1 col3-6, plus cell at (6,0) and (0,6). Not S2 output shape.\n\nMaybe shape S2 output is shape S2 input reflected across some axis? Let's reflect horizontally: (r,c)->(r, W-1-c). For W=7: (0,0)->(0,6),(3,5)->(3,1),(4,5)->(4,1),(5,5)->(5,1),(6,5)->(6,1),(6,6)->(6,0). So shape: (0,6),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,0). Not S2 output shape.\n\nReflect vertically: (H-1-r,c). For H=7: (0,0)->(6,0),(3,5)->(3,5),(4,5)->(2,5),(5,5)->(1,5),(6,5)->(0,5),(6,6)->(0,6). So shape: (6,0),(3,5),(2,5),(1,5),(0,5),(0,6). Not S2 output shape.\n\nSo S2 output shape is not a simple transform of S2 input shape.\n\nLet's examine shape S3 input and shape S2 output again: maybe S2 output shape is shape S3 rotated 180 degrees? Let's test: rotate 180: (r,c)->(H-1-r, W-1-c). For H=5, W=6: (0,0)->(4,5),(1,5)->(3,0),(2,5)->(2,0),(3,5)->(1,0),(4,4)->(0,1),(4,5)->(0,0). Coordinates: (4,5),(3,0),(2,0),(1,0),(0,1),(0,0). That's shape: vertical line at column 0 rows0-3, plus cells at (0,0),(0,1),(4,5). Not S2 output shape.\n\nSo S2 output shape is not derived from S3 input shape.\n\nMaybe S2 output shape is derived from S7 input shape? Let's test: S7 input shape bounding box rows 1-7, cols 1-4. S7 input coordinates: (0,0),(3,2),(3,3),(4,2),(5,2),(6,2),(6,3). Wait relative to top-left (1,1). So relative coordinates: (0,0),(3,2),(3,3),(4,2),(5,2),(6,2),(6,3). Rotating 90 clockwise: (r,c)->(c, H-1-r). H=7, W=4. So (0,0)->(0,6),(3,2)->(2,3),(3,3)->(3,3),(4,2)->(2,2),(5,2)->(2,1),(6,2)->(2,0),(6,3)->(3,0). So coordinates: (0,6),(2,3),(3,3),(2,2),(2,1),(2,0),(3,0). That's vertical line at row2 col0-3, plus cells at (0,6),(3,3),(3,0). Not S2 output shape.\n\nRotate 90 ccw: (r,c)->(W-1-c, r). W-1=3. So (0,0)->(3,0),(3,2)->(1,3),(3,3)->(0,3),(4,2)->(1,4),(5,2)->(1,5),(6,2)->(1,6),(6,3)->(0,6). Coordinates: (3,0),(1,3),(0,3),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(0,6). That's shape: horizontal line at row1 col3-6, plus cells at (3,0),(0,3),(0,6). Not S2 output shape.\n\nReflect horizontally: (r,c)->(r, W-1-c). W-1=3. So (0,0)->(0,3),(3,2)->(3,1),(3,3)->(3,0),(4,2)->(4,1),(5,2)->(5,1),(6,2)->(6,1),(6,3)->(6,0). Coordinates: (0,3),(3,1),(3,0),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,0). Not S2 output shape.\n\nReflect vertically: (H-1-r,c). H-1=6. So (0,0)->(6,0),(3,2)->(3,2),(3,3)->(3,3),(4,2)->(2,2),(5,2)->(1,2),(6,2)->(0,2),(6,3)->(0,3). Coordinates: (6,0),(3,2),(3,3),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3). Not S2 output shape.\n\nThus S2 output shape is not a simple transform of S7 input shape.\n\nMaybe S2 output shape is shape of 4 input? But 4 input shape is single at (0,0) and cluster at (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). Actually 4 input shape: cluster at (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7) plus single at (0,0). Output 2 shape: cluster at (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7) plus single at (0,1). So output 2 shape is same cluster as input 4 cluster but single moved from (0,0) to (0,1). So output 2 shape is input 4 shape with single moved one cell to the right. So maybe the rule is: for each color, take the shape of another color and shift the single cell relative to the cluster by one cell? Let's examine.\n\nInput 4 shape: cluster at right side plus single at (0,0). Output 2 shape: cluster at right side same as input 4 cluster, single at (0,1). So the single moved right by one. That matches the transformation: shift the single cell of the shape to the right by 1 relative to the cluster. But why output color 2? Because maybe each color's output shape is the shape of the color that is one step ahead in some ordering? Let's examine mapping of colors across examples.\n\nIn Example 1, mapping:\n\n- Color 4 input shape -> output color 4 shape (unchanged).\n- Color 2 output shape is shape of input 4 shape with single moved right by 1. So output color 2 shape derived from input 4 shape.\n- Color 3 output shape maybe derived from input 2 shape? Let's examine input 2 shape: cluster at bottom right with single at (0,1). Input 2 shape cluster: vertical line of 4 at col6 rows3-6, plus cell at (6,7). Single at (0,1). Output color 3 shape: cluster at (4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4) plus single at (1,0). That shape is not input 2 shape. So maybe mapping is different.\n\nLet's analyze mapping of shapes in Example 1 more systematically. Let's identify each shape's bounding box and relative coordinates.\n\nInput shapes:\n\n- Shape A (color 4): cluster: coordinates: (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). Single: (0,0). So shape A: cluster of 5 cells plus single at (0,0). Let's call this shape S4.\n\n- Shape B (color 2): cluster: (3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7). Single: (0,1). Shape S2.\n\n- Shape C (color 3): cluster: (2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5). Single: (1,0). Shape S3.\n\n- Shape D (color 7): cluster: (4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4). Single: (1,1). Shape S7.\n\nNow output shapes:\n\n- Color 4 output shape: cluster: (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). Single: (0,0). So same as input 4 shape. So mapping: shape S4 -> color 4 unchanged.\n\n- Color 2 output shape: cluster: (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7). Single: (0,1). So cluster same as input 4 cluster, single same as input 2 single? Wait input 2 single is (0,1). Yes output 2 single is (0,1). So output 2 shape uses cluster of shape S4 and single of shape S2. So cluster from shape S4, single from shape S2. So shape S4 cluster + single S2.\n\n- Color 3 output shape: cluster: (4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4). Single: (1,0). This cluster is same as input 7 cluster. Single same as input 3 single. So output 3 shape uses cluster of shape S7, single of shape S3.\n\n- Color 7 output shape: cluster: (2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5). Single: (1,1). This cluster is same as input 3 cluster. Single same as input 7 single. So output 7 shape uses cluster of shape S3, single of shape S7.\n\nThus mapping: each output shape uses cluster of one shape and single of another shape. The mapping seems to be: output color 2 uses cluster of shape 4, single of shape 2. Output color 3 uses cluster of shape 7, single of shape 3. Output color 7 uses cluster of shape 3, single of shape 7. Output color 4 uses cluster of shape 4, single of shape 4. So basically cluster of shape X and single of shape Y produce output color Y? Wait output 2 uses cluster of shape 4 and single of shape 2. Output 3 uses cluster of shape 7 and single of shape 3. Output 7 uses cluster of shape 3 and single of shape 7. Output 4 uses cluster of shape 4 and single of shape 4. So mapping is:\n\n- For color 4: cluster from 4, single from 4.\n- For color 2: cluster from 4, single from 2.\n- For color 3: cluster from 7, single from 3.\n- For color 7: cluster from 3, single from 7.\n\nSo mapping pairs: (cluster, single) -> output color.\n\nIt seems like each output shape's cluster comes from one shape, and its single comes from another shape. The mapping appears to be: cluster from shape A (color 4) + single from shape B (color 2) produce output color 2. cluster from shape B (color 2) + single from shape C (color 3) produce output color ??? Wait we don't have that. cluster from shape C (color 3) + single from shape D (color 7) produce output color 7. cluster from shape D (color 7) + single from shape C (color 3) produce output color 3. cluster from shape A (color 4) + single from shape A produce output color 4.\n\nSo mapping seems to be: cluster from shape i, single from shape j produce output color j? Let's check: output color 2 uses cluster from shape 4, single from shape 2. So j=2, i=4. Output color 3 uses cluster from shape 7, single from shape 3. So j=3, i=7. Output color 7 uses cluster from shape 3, single from shape 7. So j=7, i=3. Output color 4 uses cluster from shape 4, single from shape 4. So j=4, i=4. So indeed output color j uses cluster from shape i and single from shape j. So the rule: For each color j, take the single cell of shape j and combine it with the cluster of shape i, where i is some mapping from j. But how to determine i for each j? It might be that the mapping is determined by the relative positions of the single cells? Let's analyze.\n\nWe have shapes with single cells at positions:\n\n- Shape 4 single at (0,0)\n- Shape 2 single at (0,1)\n- Shape 3 single at (1,0)\n- Shape 7 single at (1,1)\n\nThe single cells positions form a 2x2 pattern: (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1). They are at the top-left corner of the grid. They seem to be the four corners of a 2x2 square. The cluster shapes are all located somewhere else in the grid. The mapping might be: cluster of shape that is diagonally opposite to the single of shape j? Let's see:\n\n- For shape 4 single at (0,0). The cluster used in output 4 is cluster of shape 4 (itself). So mapping i=4 for j=4.\n\n- For shape 2 single at (0,1). The cluster used in output 2 is cluster of shape 4. So mapping i=4 for j=2.\n\n- For shape 3 single at (1,0). The cluster used in output 3 is cluster of shape 7. So mapping i=7 for j=3.\n\n- For shape 7 single at (1,1). The cluster used in output 7 is cluster of shape 3. So mapping i=3 for j=7.\n\nSo mapping i for j: 4->4, 2->4, 3->7, 7->3. That mapping is not symmetrical: 2 maps to 4, 4 maps to 4, 3 maps to 7, 7 maps to 3. So maybe mapping is: cluster of shape that is the one whose single cell is in the same row as j's single? Let's analyze.\n\nSingle cells positions:\n\n- shape 4: (0,0)\n- shape 2: (0,1)\n- shape 3: (1,0)\n- shape 7: (1,1)\n\nSo each shape's single cell is at one of four positions: (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1). So we can think of them as four corners of a 2x2 block. The mapping i for j might be: cluster of shape that is located in the same column as j's single? Let's check: j=2 (0,1) -> cluster from shape 4 (0,0). So same column? No, 0,1 vs 0,0 share same row, not column. j=3 (1,0) -> cluster from shape 7 (1,1). So same row? Yes, both row 1. j=7 (1,1) -> cluster from shape 3 (1,0). Same row 1. j=4 (0,0) -> cluster from shape 4. Same row 0.\n\nSo mapping i for j: cluster from shape in same row as j's single, except j=2 where cluster from shape 4 (row 0). j=2's single is at row 0, so cluster from shape 4 also row 0. So mapping: cluster from shape with single in same row as j. That seems to hold: shape 4 cluster from shape 4 (row 0). shape 2 cluster from shape 4 (row 0). shape 3 cluster from shape 7 (row 1). shape 7 cluster from shape 3 (row 1). So mapping uses cluster from shape with single in same row as j's single. But there are two shapes with single in row 0: shape 4 and shape 2. Which one do we pick? For j=4 we pick shape 4. For j=2 we pick shape 4. So maybe we always pick the cluster from shape with single in the same row but not same column? Wait shape 2's single at (0,1). The cluster from shape 4 is at (0,0) (same row, different column). That might be the rule: for j's single at (r,c), we choose the cluster from the shape whose single is at (r, 1-c) (the other column in same row). So if j's single is at column 0, we use cluster from shape with single at column 1. If j's single is at column 1, we use cluster from shape with single at column 0. That matches: j=2 (0,1) -> cluster from shape with single at (0,0) (shape 4). j=3 (1,0) -> cluster from shape with single at (1,1) (shape 7). j=7 (1,1) -> cluster from shape with single at (1,0) (shape 3). j=4 (0,0) -> cluster from shape with single at (0,1) (shape 2) would be shape 2 cluster, but output 4 uses cluster of shape 4, not shape 2. So maybe for j=4 we pick cluster from shape with same single? Let's check: shape 4's single at (0,0). The shape with single at (0,1) is shape 2. So if we followed rule, we would pick cluster from shape 2, but output uses cluster from shape 4. So rule fails for shape 4. So maybe shape 4 is special: cluster from shape 4 itself. But maybe shape 4 is the \"anchor\" shape? Let's analyze Example 2 to see if similar pattern emerges.\n\nExample 2 Input shapes:\n\nColors: 1,2,3,8.\n\nSingle cells:\n\n- Color 1: single at (0,0) (top-left).\n- Color 2: single at (1,0) (row1 col0).\n- Color 3: single at (0,1) (row0 col1).\n- Color 8: single at (1,1) (row1 col1).\n\nWait check: In input 2, color 1 has single at (0,0). Color 2 has single at (1,0). Color 3 has single at (0,1). Color 8 has single at (1,1). Yes.\n\nSo single cells positions again form a 2x2 block at top-left. Good.\n\nNow output shapes:\n\n- Color 1 output shape: coordinates: (0,0),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6). That shape is same as input shape of 1? Let's check: input shape of 1: (0,0),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6). Yes output 1 shape is identical to input 1 shape. So color 1 unchanged.\n\n- Color 2 output shape: coordinates: (1,0),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7). That shape is same as input shape of 8? Wait input shape of 8: (1,1),(4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7). That's 6 cells. Output 2 shape has 5 cells: missing (1,1) and (4,7). So output 2 shape is input 8 shape minus two cells? Actually input 8 shape: cluster at bottom right (4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7) plus single at (1,1). Output 2 shape: cluster at bottom right (5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7) plus single at (1,0). So output 2 shape uses cluster of input 8 but without the cell at (4,7). So cluster is same as input 8 cluster minus one cell? Actually input 8 cluster: cells at (4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7). Output 2 cluster: (5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7). So cluster missing (4,7). So cluster is smaller. But maybe shape is same shape but moved? Wait input 8 cluster shape: 2x2 square at (5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7) plus one cell at (4,7) above right side. Output 2 cluster: same 2x2 square at (5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7) but missing the top right cell. So cluster changed shape. But maybe output 2 shape is shape of 8 input but with the top right cell removed? But why?\n\n- Color 3 output shape: coordinates: (0,1),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6). That's shape of 1 input? Wait input shape of 1: (0,0),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6). Output 3 shape: missing (0,0),(1,6). So shape of 1 input minus two cells. So output 3 shape is shape of 1 input minus top row cells? Actually output 3 shape includes cluster at (2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6) plus single at (0,1). So shape of 1 input but with top row cells removed and single moved to (0,1). So output 3 shape uses cluster of shape 1 but with single of shape 3.\n\n- Color 8 output shape: coordinates: (1,1),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7). That's shape of 2 input? Wait input shape of 2: (1,0),(5,4),(6,4),(7,4),(8,4). That's vertical line at col4 plus single at (1,0). Output 8 shape: cluster at bottom right (5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7) plus single at (1,1). That's shape of 8 input cluster? Wait input 8 cluster is same as output 8 cluster but with single at (1,1) instead of (1,0). So output 8 shape uses cluster of input 8? Actually cluster of input 8 is same as output 8 cluster. Single of output 8 is at (1,1), which is input 8 single? Wait input 8 single is at (1,1). Yes. So output 8 shape uses cluster of input 8 and single of input 8? But cluster of input 8 includes the cell at (4,7) which is missing in output 8 cluster. Wait output 8 cluster: (5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7). Input 8 cluster: (4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7). So output 8 cluster missing (4,7). So cluster changed again.\n\nLet's analyze more carefully: Input shapes for Example 2:\n\n- Shape of 1: cluster: (1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6) plus single (0,0). So shape of 1 is like a vertical line at col6 rows1-4 plus horizontal block at rows2-3 col4-6, plus single at (0,0).\n\n- Shape of 2: cluster: vertical line at col4 rows5-8 plus single at (1,0). So shape of 2 is vertical line of 5 at col4 plus single at (1,0).\n\n- Shape of 3: cluster: horizontal line at row4 col2-5 plus vertical line at col2-3 rows5-6? Actually shape of 3: coordinates: (4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,2),(5,3). So shape of 3 is a horizontal line of 4 at row4 col2-5 plus vertical line at col2-3 row5? Actually vertical line at col2-3 row5 only. So shape of 3 is like a \"T\" shape rotated? Actually it's like a horizontal line of 4 with two cells below at left side.\n\n- Shape of 8: cluster: 2x2 square at rows5-6 col6-7 plus single at (1,1). So shape of 8 is a 2x2 square plus single at (1,1).\n\nNow output shapes:\n\n- Shape of 1: unchanged (cluster and single same). So shape of 1 output uses cluster of shape 1 and single of shape 1.\n\n- Shape of 2 output: cluster: (5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7) plus single at (1,0). This cluster is the same as shape of 8 cluster minus the cell at (4,7). So shape of 2 output uses cluster of shape 8 but missing one cell. Single of shape 2 is at (1,0). So shape of 2 output uses cluster of shape 8 but not the top cell. So maybe the rule is that cluster of shape 8 is moved down by 1 row? Wait shape of 8 cluster originally at rows5-6 col6-7. That cluster is same as output cluster of shape 2. So cluster of shape 8 is unchanged. So shape of 2 output uses cluster of shape 8. Single of shape 2 remains at (1,0). So shape of 2 output uses cluster of shape 8 and single of shape 2.\n\n- Shape of 3 output: cluster: (2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6) plus single at (0,1). This cluster is same as shape of 1 cluster minus the cell at (1,6) and maybe the single at (0,0). Actually shape of 1 cluster includes (1,6) as part of vertical line. But output cluster of 3 includes no cell at (1,6). So cluster of shape 1 is missing the topmost cell at (1,6). But cluster of shape 1 includes other cells: (2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6). That matches output cluster of 3. So cluster of shape 1 minus the top cell (1,6). So shape of 3 output uses cluster of shape 1 but missing the topmost cell? Actually shape of 1 cluster had 8 cells; output cluster of 3 has 7 cells (missing (1,6)). So cluster of shape 1 minus one cell. Single of shape 3 is at (0,1). So shape of 3 output uses cluster of shape 1 minus one cell and single of shape 3.\n\n- Shape of 8 output: cluster: (5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7) plus single at (1,1). This cluster is same as shape of 8 cluster minus the cell at (4,7). Single of shape 8 remains at (1,1). So shape of 8 output uses cluster of shape 8 minus one cell and single of shape 8. Wait shape of 8 cluster had 5 cells; output cluster has 4 cells. So shape of 8 output uses cluster of shape 8 minus the topmost cell (4,7). So cluster of shape 8 minus one cell. Single of shape 8 remains.\n\nThus mapping in Example 2: output shape of color j uses cluster of shape k (some other shape) minus one cell (the topmost cell of that cluster), and single of shape j. Let's examine mapping pairs:\n\n- Output 2 uses cluster of shape 8 minus one cell (topmost cell). Single of shape 2 remains at (1,0).\n- Output 3 uses cluster of shape 1 minus one cell (topmost cell). Single of shape 3 remains at (0,1).\n- Output 8 uses cluster of shape 8 minus one cell? Wait output 8 uses cluster of shape 8 minus one cell? Actually output 8 cluster same as shape 8 cluster minus (4,7). But shape 8 cluster had (4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7). So output 8 cluster is shape 8 cluster minus (4,7). So cluster of shape 8 minus one cell. Single of shape 8 remains. So output 8 shape uses cluster of shape 8 minus one cell and single of shape 8. But that is the same as output 2 shape? Wait output 2 shape uses cluster of shape 8 minus one cell. So output 2 and output 8 use the same cluster? But output 2 uses cluster of shape 8 minus one cell and single of shape 2. Output 8 uses cluster of shape 8 minus one cell and single of shape 8. So both use same cluster. So cluster of shape 8 is used by two colors: 2 and 8. But cluster of shape 8 minus one cell is used for both. So cluster of shape 8 is reused. So cluster of shape 8 is used by both 2 and 8 output shapes. Similarly cluster of shape 1 minus one cell is used by output 3 shape only. So cluster of shape 1 is used by output 3 only.\n\nBut cluster of shape 2 is not used by any output shape? Actually shape of 2 cluster (vertical line at col4 rows5-8) is not used by any output shape. Similarly cluster of shape 3 is not used by any output shape. So clusters of shape 2 and shape 3 are unused. So the mapping is not symmetrical.\n\nLet's analyze Example 3.\n\nExample 3 Input shapes:\n\nColors: 9,4,7,6.\n\nSingle cells:\n\n- Color 9: single at (0,1).\n- Color 4: single at (0,1)? Wait color 4 has single at (0,1) as well? Actually input row0 col1 is 4. So color 4 single at (0,1). Wait but we have color 9 also at (0,1). That can't be. Let's double-check input example 3:\n\nRow0: 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 7 6 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 0 7 9 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0 7 4 0 0 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 6 6 7 0 0 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 7 6 6 0 0 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow8: all zeros\nRow9: all zeros\n\nSo colors:\n\n- 9: at (0,0),(1,5),(1,6),(2,6). Actually row0 col0 is 9, row1 col5 is 9, row1 col6 is 9, row2 col6 is 9. So color 9 has single at (0,0) plus cluster at bottom right.\n\n- 4: at (0,1),(3,5),(4,5). So color 4 has single at (0,1) and cluster at bottom right.\n\n- 7: at (1,0),(2,5),(4,4),(5,5),(6,3),(6,4). So color 7 has single at (1,0) and cluster at bottom right.\n\n- 6: at (1,1),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). So color 6 has single at (1,1) and cluster at bottom right.\n\nSo single cells positions: (0,0) for 9, (0,1) for 4, (1,0) for 7, (1,1) for 6. So again a 2x2 block of single cells at top-left.\n\nNow output shapes:\n\n- Color 9 output shape: coordinates: (0,0),(3,5),(4,5). That shape is cluster of 4 input? Wait input 4 cluster: (3,5),(4,5). Yes. So output 9 shape uses cluster of 4 input plus single of 9? Single of 9 is at (0,0). Output 9 shape: (0,0) plus cluster (3,5),(4,5). So shape of 9 output uses cluster of 4 input and single of 9.\n\n- Color 4 output shape: coordinates: (1,5),(1,6),(2,6). That shape is cluster of 9 input? Wait input 9 cluster: (1,5),(1,6),(2,6). Yes. So output 4 shape uses cluster of 9 input plus single of 4? Single of 4 is at (0,1). Output 4 shape: (1,5),(1,6),(2,6). There's no single at (0,1). So shape of 4 output uses cluster of 9 input but no single. Actually output 4 shape has only cluster of 9 input (3 cells). So maybe the single of 4 is removed? But maybe output 4 shape uses cluster of 9 input and single of 4? But single of 4 is at (0,1) which is not present. So maybe the rule is that the single of 4 is moved to the cluster of 9 input? But output 4 shape does not include single at (0,1). So maybe the rule is that the cluster of 9 input is used as the cluster for 4 output, but the single of 4 is not used. But maybe the single of 4 is used for some other output shape.\n\n- Color 6 output shape: coordinates: (1,1),(2,5),(4,4),(5,5),(6,4). That shape is cluster of 7 input? Wait input 7 cluster: (2,5),(4,4),(5,5),(6,3),(6,4). That's 5 cells. Output 6 shape: (1,1),(2,5),(4,4),(5,5),(6,4). So output 6 shape uses cluster of 7 input but with cell at (6,3) replaced by (1,1) single of 6. So shape of 6 output uses cluster of 7 input minus one cell at (6,3) plus single of 6 at (1,1). So cluster of 7 input minus one cell plus single of 6.\n\n- Color 7 output shape: coordinates: (1,0),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). That shape is cluster of 6 input? Wait input 6 cluster: (5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). That's 4 cells. Output 7 shape: (1,0),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5). So output 7 shape uses cluster of 6 input plus single of 7 at (1,0). So cluster of 6 input plus single of 7.\n\nSo mapping:\n\n- Output 9 uses cluster of 4 input + single of 9.\n- Output 4 uses cluster of 9 input (no single).\n- Output 6 uses cluster of 7 input minus one cell + single of 6.\n- Output 7 uses cluster of 6 input + single of 7.\n\nThus mapping is not uniform.\n\nWe need to find a consistent rule that explains all examples.\n\nLet's analyze shapes more systematically.\n\nGoal: Identify transformation rule that maps input shapes to output shapes.\n\nObservations:\n\n- In all examples, there are 4 colors. Each color appears as a shape consisting of a cluster of many cells and a single isolated cell. The single isolated cell is always at one of the four positions forming a 2x2 block at the top-left corner of the grid. Indeed, in each example, the single cells are at positions:\n\nExample 1: (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) for colors 4,2,3,7 respectively. Actually we need to confirm: In Example 1, color 4 single at (0,0). Color 2 single at (0,1). Color 3 single at (1,0). Color 7 single at (1,1). Yes.\n\nExample 2: color 1 single at (0,0). Color 2 single at (1,0). Color 3 single at (0,1). Color 8 single at (1,1). Yes.\n\nExample 3: color 9 single at (0,0). Color 4 single at (0,1). Color 7 single at (1,0). Color 6 single at (1,1). Yes.\n\nSo indeed, each color has a single cell at one of the four corners of a 2x2 block at the top-left. The cluster of each color is elsewhere in the grid, often forming a shape like an L, a T, a square, etc.\n\nNow, output shapes: In each example, the clusters of shapes are relocated, sometimes rotated, sometimes mirrored, sometimes moved to new positions. The single cells also may change positions or be removed.\n\nBut there seems to be a consistent pattern: the output shapes appear to be arranged in a 2x2 block at the top-left as well? Let's check output grids:\n\nExample 1 output: top-left 2x2 block contains colors: (0,0)=4, (0,1)=2, (1,0)=3, (1,1)=7. So yes, the same as input.\n\nExample 2 output: top-left 2x2 block: (0,0)=1, (0,1)=3, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=8. Wait input top-left block: (0,0)=1, (0,1)=3, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=8. So same arrangement. So top-left block unchanged.\n\nExample 3 output: top-left 2x2 block: (0,0)=9, (0,1)=4, (1,0)=7, (1,1)=6. Input top-left block: same arrangement. So top-left block unchanged. So the 2x2 block of single cells remains the same in output. So the single cells remain at the same coordinates. So we keep the single cells in place.\n\nThus the transformation only affects the clusters (the shapes of the colors). The single cells remain at their original positions.\n\nNow, we need to see how clusters transform.\n\nLet's analyze each example in terms of mapping of clusters between colors.\n\nExample 1 clusters:\n\nInput clusters:\n\n- 4 cluster: at (1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7)\n- 2 cluster: at (3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7)\n- 3 cluster: at (2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5)\n- 7 cluster: at (4,3),(4,4),(5,3),(6,3),(7,3),(7,4)\n\nOutput clusters:\n\n- 4 cluster: same as input 4 cluster\n- 2 cluster: same as input 4 cluster\n- 3 cluster: same as input 7 cluster\n- 7 cluster: same as input 3 cluster\n\nThus mapping of clusters:\n\n- Cluster of color 4 stays with color 4 and also used for color 2.\n- Cluster of color 2 is not used for any output cluster (except maybe used for something else? Actually no).\n- Cluster of color 3 is used for output color 7.\n- Cluster of color 7 is used for output color 3.\n\nSo clusters are swapped between some colors: cluster of 3 goes to 7, cluster of 7 goes to 3. Cluster of 4 stays. Cluster of 2 is unused (or maybe used for something else? But no).\n\nBut wait, output 2 cluster is same as input 4 cluster. So cluster of 4 used for output color 2. So cluster of 4 is used for both 4 and 2. So cluster of 4 is duplicated. So cluster of 4 is used for two colors. That is interesting.\n\nThus clusters are not uniquely mapped; some clusters may be duplicated or omitted.\n\nLet's check Example 2 clusters:\n\nInput clusters:\n\n- 1 cluster: (1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6)\n- 2 cluster: (5,4),(6,4),(7,4),(8,4) (vertical line of 4 at col4 rows5-8)\n- 3 cluster: (4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,2),(5,3) (horizontal line of 4 at row4 col2-5 plus two cells below at left)\n- 8 cluster: (4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7) (2x2 square at rows5-6 col6-7 plus one cell above at (4,7))\n\nOutput clusters:\n\n- 1 cluster: same as input 1 cluster\n- 2 cluster: cluster of 8 minus top cell (4,7) -> (5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7)\n- 3 cluster: cluster of 1 minus top cell (1,6) -> (2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6)\n- 8 cluster: cluster of 8 minus top cell (4,7) -> (5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7)\n\nSo clusters mapping:\n\n- 1 cluster remains unchanged.\n- 2 cluster uses cluster of 8 minus one cell.\n- 3 cluster uses cluster of 1 minus one cell.\n- 8 cluster uses cluster of 8 minus one cell.\n\nSo cluster of 8 is used for both 2 and 8 output. Cluster of 1 used for 3 output. Cluster of 2 and cluster of 3 are unused.\n\nThus cluster of 8 is duplicated.\n\nExample 3 clusters:\n\nInput clusters:\n\n- 9 cluster: (1,5),(1,6),(2,6)\n- 4 cluster: (3,5),(4,5)\n- 7 cluster: (2,5),(4,4),(5,5),(6,3),(6,4)\n- 6 cluster: (5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5)\n\nOutput clusters:\n\n- 9 cluster: cluster of 4 (3,5),(4,5) plus single of 9 at (0,0)\n- 4 cluster: cluster of 9 (1,5),(1,6),(2,6)\n- 6 cluster: cluster of 7 minus (6,3) plus single of 6 at (1,1)\n- 7 cluster: cluster of 6 (5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5) plus single of 7 at (1,0)\n\nThus mapping:\n\n- 9 output uses cluster of 4.\n- 4 output uses cluster of 9.\n- 6 output uses cluster of 7 minus one cell.\n- 7 output uses cluster of 6.\n\nSo cluster of 4 used for 9, cluster of 9 used for 4, cluster of 6 used for 7, cluster of 7 used for 6 (but missing one cell). So clusters are swapped between pairs: 9 <-> 4, 6 <-> 7. But cluster of 7 is missing one cell in output 6. Cluster of 6 used fully for 7. So cluster of 7 partially used for 6.\n\nThus overall pattern: clusters are swapped between colors in some pairing, sometimes duplicated, sometimes truncated.\n\nWe need to find a consistent rule that explains all these.\n\nLet's examine the shapes in more detail. Perhaps the rule is that we rotate each cluster by 90 degrees around the center of the 2x2 block of singles? Or maybe we reflect them across a diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each cluster is moved to the position of the single cell of the same color, or the single cell of another color. But the single cells are at top-left, not moving. But clusters may be moved to positions relative to the 2x2 block.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: For each color, take the cluster of that color and reposition it such that its \"anchor\" cell (the one that is closest to the 2x2 block) ends up at the location of the single cell of another color. But the single cells remain in place. That is, we shift the cluster such that its relative position to the 2x2 block changes.\n\nLet's examine Example 1: For each color, the cluster shape is moved relative to the 2x2 block.\n\n- For color 4: cluster is originally at right side of grid, far from the 2x2 block. In output, cluster remains same. So cluster of 4 not moved.\n\n- For color 2: cluster originally at bottom-right side. In output, cluster remains same as input 4 cluster. So cluster of 2 moved to the position of cluster of 4. So cluster of 2 relocated to the location of cluster of 4.\n\n- For color 3: cluster originally at bottom-right. In output, cluster relocated to location of cluster of 7.\n\n- For color 7: cluster originally at bottom-left side. In output, cluster relocated to location of cluster of 3.\n\nThus cluster of each color is moved to the position of the cluster of another color. The mapping is:\n\n- cluster of 4 -> stays at its original position.\n- cluster of 2 -> moves to position of cluster of 4.\n- cluster of 3 -> moves to position of cluster of 7.\n- cluster of 7 -> moves to position of cluster of 3.\n\nSo cluster mapping is a permutation of clusters: 4 stays, 2->4, 3->7, 7->3. So it's a permutation of {4,2,3,7}.\n\nNow, in Example 2: cluster mapping:\n\n- cluster of 1 stays at its original position.\n- cluster of 2 unused.\n- cluster of 3 unused.\n- cluster of 8 used for both 2 and 8 output, but cluster of 8 remains at its original position? Actually cluster of 8 is at (4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7). In output, cluster of 8 appears at same position (5,6),(5,7),(6,6),(6,7) for output 2 and 8. The top cell (4,7) is missing in output, but cluster of 8 originally had that cell. So cluster of 8 is partially truncated. But cluster of 8 remains at its original location (except for missing cell). So cluster of 8 stays.\n\n- cluster of 1 used for output 3, but truncated.\n\nThus cluster mapping: 1 stays, 8 stays, 2 and 3 unused.\n\nExample 3: cluster mapping:\n\n- cluster of 9 moved to position of cluster of 4.\n- cluster of 4 moved to position of cluster of 9.\n- cluster of 7 moved to position of cluster of 6 (but truncated).\n- cluster of 6 moved to position of cluster of 7.\n\nThus cluster mapping: 9<->4, 7<->6. So cluster of 9 swapped with cluster of 4; cluster of 7 swapped with cluster of 6.\n\nThus cluster mapping is a permutation of clusters: sometimes identity, sometimes swap.\n\nIt seems the permutation may be determined by the relative positions of the single cells. For each color, we might map the cluster to the position of the cluster whose single cell is at a position that is \"opposite\" or \"adjacent\" to the color's single cell. But let's analyze.\n\nLet's label colors and their single cells:\n\nExample 1:\n\nColor 4: single at (0,0)\nColor 2: single at (0,1)\nColor 3: single at (1,0)\nColor 7: single at (1,1)\n\nWe can represent this as a 2x2 grid of singles: top-left (0,0) color 4, top-right (0,1) color 2, bottom-left (1,0) color 3, bottom-right (1,1) color 7.\n\nNow cluster mapping: 4 stays (maps to itself). 2 maps to cluster of 4. 3 maps to cluster of 7. 7 maps to cluster of 3.\n\nSo mapping of clusters corresponds to mapping of singles? Let's see: For each color, we might map cluster to the cluster of the color whose single is at the \"opposite\" corner? Let's define opposite corners: (0,0) opposite (1,1). (0,1) opposite (1,0). So mapping might be: cluster of color at (0,0) stays (since opposite is itself? Actually opposite of (0,0) is (1,1) which is color 7, not 4). But cluster of 4 stays, not mapping to 7. So not opposite.\n\nMaybe mapping is based on the relative direction of the cluster: cluster of color at (0,0) is at right side; cluster of color at (0,1) is at bottom-right; cluster of color at (1,0) is at bottom-left; cluster of color at (1,1) is at bottom-left too. But mapping might be: cluster of color at (0,1) moves to the position of cluster of color at (0,0). cluster of color at (1,0) moves to position of cluster of color at (1,1). cluster of color at (1,1) moves to position of cluster of color at (1,0). cluster of color at (0,0) stays. So mapping is: cluster of color at (0,1) moves left; cluster of color at (1,0) moves right; cluster of color at (1,1) moves left? Actually cluster of 7 (1,1) moves to position of cluster of 3 (1,0). So cluster of 7 moves left. cluster of 3 moves right. So cluster of 2 moves left. cluster of 4 stays. So maybe rule: cluster of color at (0,1) moves left, cluster at (1,1) moves left, cluster at (1,0) moves right, cluster at (0,0) stays. That seems arbitrary.\n\nBut maybe the mapping is determined by the cluster's orientation relative to the 2x2 block: cluster of color at (0,0) is to the right of the block; cluster of color at (0,1) is below the block; cluster of color at (1,0) is below the block; cluster of color at (1,1) is below the block. But cluster of 4 stays because it's the only one that is not overlapping? This is not clear.\n\nLet's examine Example 2 mapping in terms of positions of clusters relative to the 2x2 block:\n\nExample 2 cluster positions:\n\n- cluster of 1: at bottom right (rows1-4, cols4-6). Actually cluster of 1 is at (1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6). This cluster is near the center of grid.\n\n- cluster of 2: at bottom left vertical line at col4 rows5-8. That's far bottom.\n\n- cluster of 3: at middle-left horizontal line at row4 col2-5 plus two cells below at left. That's near left side.\n\n- cluster of 8: at bottom right 2x2 square at rows5-6 col6-7 plus one cell above at (4,7). So cluster of 8 is at bottom right.\n\nNow mapping:\n\n- cluster of 1 stays.\n- cluster of 2 unused.\n- cluster of 3 unused.\n- cluster of 8 used for output 2 and 8.\n\nSo cluster of 8 stays at its position. cluster of 1 stays at its position. cluster of 2 and 3 are not used. So mapping is not a permutation but a partial mapping.\n\nBut maybe the rule is: For each color, we move the cluster to the position of the cluster of the color whose single is at the same row or column as that color's single. Let's test:\n\n- For color 1 (single at (0,0)), same row: row 0. Which colors have single in row 0? Colors 1 and 3. Which cluster to use? It uses cluster of 1 itself. So cluster of 1 stays.\n\n- For color 2 (single at (1,0)), same row: row 1. Which colors have single in row 1? Colors 2 and 7. Which cluster to use? It uses cluster of 8. So cluster of 8 is from color 8 which has single at (1,1). So cluster of 8 is from the other color in row 1. So cluster of 2 uses cluster of color 8.\n\n- For color 3 (single at (0,1)), same row: row 0. Which colors have single in row 0? Colors 1 and 3. Which cluster to use? It uses cluster of 1. So cluster of 3 uses cluster of color 1 (the other color in row 0). So cluster of 3 uses cluster of color 1.\n\n- For color 8 (single at (1,1)), same row: row 1. Which colors have single in row 1? Colors 2 and 8. Which cluster to use? It uses cluster of 8 itself (or maybe cluster of 8). So cluster of 8 stays.\n\nThus rule: For each color, we map its cluster to the cluster of the other color in the same row (or itself if it's the only one in that row). But in Example 2, there are two colors in each row: row 0 has colors 1 and 3, row 1 has colors 2 and 8. So mapping: color 1 cluster stays (since the other color 3 cluster is used by color 3). Color 3 cluster uses cluster of 1. Color 2 cluster uses cluster of 8. Color 8 cluster stays. So mapping is: each pair of colors in same row swap clusters, but if one cluster is used by the other, it stays.\n\nBut cluster of 2 uses cluster of 8, cluster of 8 stays. So cluster of 8 is used by both 2 and 8. So cluster of 8 is not swapped; it's duplicated. So rule might be: cluster of one color in a row is used by the other color, but the cluster of the other color remains unchanged. But that would mean cluster of 1 stays, cluster of 3 uses cluster of 1. cluster of 2 uses cluster of 8, cluster of 8 stays. So cluster of 1 used by 3, cluster of 8 used by 2. That matches the mapping.\n\nBut cluster of 1 stays, cluster of 3 uses cluster of 1. cluster of 2 uses cluster of 8. cluster of 8 stays. So cluster of 1 used by 3, cluster of 8 used by 2. So cluster of 1 used by 3 but cluster of 1 remains. cluster of 8 used by 2 but cluster of 8 remains. So clusters of 1 and 8 are used by both themselves and another color. So cluster duplication occurs.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0 has colors 4 and 2. Row 1 has colors 3 and 7. So mapping: cluster of 4 stays, cluster of 2 uses cluster of 4. cluster of 3 uses cluster of 7, cluster of 7 stays. So cluster of 4 used by 2 but remains, cluster of 7 used by 3 but remains. So cluster duplication occurs again.\n\nIn Example 3, row 0 has colors 9 and 4. Row 1 has colors 7 and 6. So mapping: cluster of 9 uses cluster of 4? Actually output 9 uses cluster of 4. cluster of 4 uses cluster of 9. So cluster of 9 used by 4, cluster of 4 used by 9. So cluster of 9 used by 4 and remains? Wait cluster of 9 is used by 4 but cluster of 9 remains? In output, cluster of 9 appears at its original position? Actually cluster of 9 is at (1,5),(1,6),(2,6). In output, cluster of 9 is not present? Wait output 9 cluster is (3,5),(4,5). Wait check: output 9 cluster: (3,5),(4,5). That is cluster of 4 input. So cluster of 9 moved to position of cluster of 4. So cluster of 9 is moved. cluster of 4 moved to position of cluster of 9. So clusters swapped between 9 and 4. So cluster of 9 does not remain at its original position; it moved to 4's position. cluster of 4 moved to 9's position. So cluster duplication didn't happen. So mapping is a swap.\n\nThus mapping rule may depend on something else, not just row.\n\nLet's examine mapping in terms of columns of single cells:\n\nExample 1: column 0 has colors 4 and 3. Column 1 has colors 2 and 7. So mapping: cluster of 4 stays, cluster of 3 uses cluster of 7, cluster of 2 uses cluster of 4, cluster of 7 stays. So cluster of 4 used by 2 but remains. cluster of 7 used by 3 but remains.\n\nExample 2: column 0 has colors 1 and 2. Column 1 has colors 3 and 8. Mapping: cluster of 1 stays, cluster of 2 uses cluster of 8, cluster of 3 uses cluster of 1, cluster of 8 stays. So cluster of 1 used by 3 but remains. cluster of 8 used by 2 but remains.\n\nExample 3: column 0 has colors 9 and 7. Column 1 has colors 4 and 6. Mapping: cluster of 9 uses cluster of 4, cluster of 7 uses cluster of 6, cluster of 4 uses cluster of 9, cluster of 6 uses cluster of 7. So cluster of 9 used by 4 and moved, cluster of 4 used by 9 and moved, cluster of 7 used by 6 and moved, cluster of 6 used by 7 and moved. So cluster duplication didn't happen.\n\nThus mapping appears to be: for each column, cluster of color in that column might be swapped with cluster of the other color in same column. But in Example 1, cluster of 4 stays, cluster of 3 uses cluster of 7. So cluster of 4 stays, cluster of 3 uses cluster of 7. So cluster of 3 moved to 7's position, cluster of 7 stays. So cluster of 4 stays, cluster of 7 stays. So cluster of 3 moved to 7's position. So cluster of 4 and 7 remain, cluster of 3 moved. In Example 2, cluster of 1 stays, cluster of 3 uses cluster of 1. cluster of 2 uses cluster of 8, cluster of 8 stays. So cluster of 1 and 8 stay, cluster of 2 and 3 moved. In Example 3, cluster of 9 moved to 4's position, cluster of 4 moved to 9's position, cluster of 7 moved to 6's position, cluster of 6 moved to 7's position. So all clusters moved.\n\nSo mapping may be: for each column, cluster of the color that is on the left side of the 2x2 block moves to the position of the cluster of the color on the right side? But which is left and right? In Example 1, column 0 has colors 4 and 3: left side color 4 (col0), right side color 3 (col0 also). Actually both are in column 0. So left vs right not defined.\n\nMaybe mapping is based on the orientation of the cluster relative to the 2x2 block: cluster that is to the right of the block stays, cluster that is below the block moves left? Let's analyze cluster positions relative to the 2x2 block.\n\nExample 1: cluster of 4 is to the right of the block. cluster of 2 is to the right of the block but below? Actually cluster of 2 is below the block. cluster of 3 is below the block. cluster of 7 is below the block. So cluster of 4 is the only one that is not below the block? Actually cluster of 4 is also below the block: it's at rows1-4, col6-7. The block is at rows0-1, col0-1. So cluster of 4 is below the block too. But cluster of 4 is the only one that has a single at (0,0) above it? Actually cluster of 4 is far right. cluster of 2 is far right too but more below. cluster of 3 and 7 are far left? Actually cluster of 3 and 7 are at columns 3-5 and 3-4. So cluster of 3 and 7 are left side, cluster of 4 and 2 are right side. So mapping: cluster of 4 stays, cluster of 2 moves to cluster of 4's position. cluster of 3 moves to cluster of 7's position. cluster of 7 stays. So cluster of left side shapes moved to each other? Actually cluster of 3 moved to 7's position, cluster of 7 stayed. So cluster of 7 remained. So cluster of left side shapes: 3 moved, 7 stayed. cluster of right side shapes: 4 stayed, 2 moved.\n\nExample 2: cluster of 1 is at middle-right, cluster of 2 at bottom-left, cluster of 3 at left side, cluster of 8 at bottom-right. So cluster of 1 stays, cluster of 2 moves to 8's position, cluster of 3 moves to 1's position, cluster of 8 stays. So cluster of left side shapes: 3 moved, cluster of 8 stayed. cluster of right side shapes: 1 stayed, cluster of 2 moved.\n\nExample 3: cluster of 9 at right side, cluster of 4 at right side, cluster of 7 at left side, cluster of 6 at left side. cluster of 9 moved to 4's position, cluster of 4 moved to 9's position, cluster of 7 moved to 6's position, cluster",
    "6": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze ARC puzzle. We have 3 training examples with inputs and outputs. Need to infer transformation rule. Let's parse them.\n\nExample 1: Input grid size 12x12. Colors: 8, 2, 0. Output grid also 12x12. Observing pattern: In input, there are two shapes: a vertical line of 8's at left side? Let's inspect input.\n\nInput Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n\nSo pattern: The grid has two colors: 8 and 2. They appear in a diagonal pattern: 8's along diagonal from (0,0) to (10,10)? Wait row 0 col 0 has 8. Row 2 col 2 has 8. Row 4 col 4 has 8. Row 6 col 6 has 8. Row 8 col 8 has 8. Row 10 col 10 has 8. That's a diagonal of 8's spaced 2 apart? Actually each 8 is separated by 2 rows and 2 columns. Similarly, 2's appear in 2x2 blocks along the same diagonal: at (1,0) and (1,1) block? Wait 2's appear at (1,0),(1,1) row 1 col 0-1. At (3,2),(3,3). At (5,4),(5,5). At (7,6),(7,7). At (9,8),(9,9). At (11,10),(11,11). So each 2's block is 2x2, offset by 2 from previous. So essentially a pattern of 8's at diagonal positions, and 2's at adjacent cells forming 2x2 squares following that diagonal.\n\nIn output Example 1: Let's examine output grid:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObserving: The pattern seems rotated 180 degrees? Actually original pattern had 8's at top-left to bottom-right diagonal. Output pattern has 8's at bottom-right to top-left? Let's check: Output row 10 col 0 has 8. Row 8 col 2 has 8. Row 6 col 4 has 8. Row 4 col 6 has 8. Row 2 col 8 has 8. Row 0 col 10 has 8. So yes, the 8's have moved along the same diagonal but reversed orientation: starting at bottom-left? Wait bottom-left is row 10 col 0? Actually bottom-left is row 11 col 0? But row 10 col 0 has 8. Row 11 col 1? Actually row 11 col 1 has 2? Wait row 11 col 1 has 2. Let's map.\n\nIn input, 8's at coordinates (0,0), (2,2), (4,4), (6,6), (8,8), (10,10). In output, 8's at coordinates (10,0), (8,2), (6,4), (4,6), (2,8), (0,10). That's basically each 8 moved leftwards? Actually original 8 at (0,0) moved to (10,0). So moved down 10 rows. Original 8 at (2,2) moved to (8,2). So moved down 6 rows. Actually difference: (0,0) -> (10,0). (2,2) -> (8,2). (4,4) -> (6,4). (6,6) -> (4,6). (8,8) -> (2,8). (10,10) -> (0,10). So basically the pattern is mirrored across the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). Wait if we reflect across the anti-diagonal (i.e., transpose across the line from top-right to bottom-left), coordinates transform (r,c) -> (c, N-1-r). But here N=12. Let's compute: For input (0,0), anti-diagonal reflection would map to (0,11)? Actually N-1-r = 11. So (0,0) -> (0,11). But output has (10,0). So not that.\n\nMaybe it's rotated 180 degrees? Rotating 180 would map (r,c) -> (N-1-r, N-1-c). For (0,0) -> (11,11). But output has (10,0). So not that.\n\nMaybe it's rotated 90 degrees clockwise? That would map (r,c) -> (c, N-1-r). For (0,0) -> (0,11). Not.\n\nMaybe it's rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise? (r,c) -> (N-1-c, r). (0,0) -> (11,0). Output has (10,0). So not.\n\nMaybe it's mirrored vertically? (r,c) -> (N-1-r, c). (0,0) -> (11,0). Output (10,0). So not.\n\nMaybe it's mirrored horizontally? (r,c) -> (r, N-1-c). (0,0) -> (0,11). Not.\n\nMaybe it's translation along diagonal? Let's see: For each 8, its row index decreases by 2, but column index increases by 2? Wait: Input (0,0) -> (10,0). Row increased by 10, column unchanged. Input (2,2) -> (8,2). Row increased by 6, column unchanged. Input (4,4) -> (6,4). Row increased by 2. Input (6,6) -> (4,6). Row decreased by 2. Input (8,8) -> (2,8). Row decreased by 6. Input (10,10) -> (0,10). Row decreased by 10. So pattern: For each 8, row changes by (10 - 2*index?) Let's analyze index along diagonal: index i from 0 to 5. Input coordinates: (2i, 2i). Output coordinates: (10-2i, 2i). Because row 10-2i: For i=0, row=10, col=0. For i=1, row=8, col=2. For i=2, row=6, col=4. For i=3, row=4, col=6. For i=4, row=2, col=8. For i=5, row=0, col=10. Yes, output row = 10-2i, col = 2i. So the pattern is a diagonal line of 8's that starts at (10,0) and ends at (0,10). That's the anti-diagonal offset by 1? Actually anti-diagonal would be (0,11),(1,10),(2,9),(3,8),(4,7),(5,6),(6,5),(7,4),(8,3),(9,2),(10,1),(11,0). But here we have (10,0),(8,2),(6,4),(4,6),(2,8),(0,10). That's a diagonal from bottom-left to top-right but offset by 2 columns? Wait bottom-left is (11,0). We have (10,0). So it's not bottom-left corner but one row above. So it's a diagonal of slope -1 but offset by one row. Actually coordinates satisfy row+col=10? Let's check: For (10,0): row+col=10. For (8,2): 10. For (6,4): 10. For (4,6): 10. For (2,8): 10. For (0,10): 10. So yes, it's a diagonal where row+col=10. That's a line parallel to anti-diagonal but offset by 1 from the anti-diagonal (which is row+col=11). So the 8's moved from row=2i, col=2i (so row+col=4i) to row+col=10. So each 8 moved along a line of constant row+col=10, i.e., the line connecting (10,0) to (0,10). So the transformation for 8's is to shift them along that diagonal to the line row+col=10. But why row+col=10? Because the grid size is 12, so maybe the output diagonal is the one that is symmetrical to the input diagonal? Let's analyze: Input 8's are on the main diagonal row=col. Output 8's are on the anti-diagonal offset by 1 (row+col=10). So maybe the rule is: reflect across the main diagonal? That would map (r,c) to (c,r). But for (0,0) -> (0,0). Not.\n\nMaybe the rule is to rotate 90 degrees? But 8's rotated 90 degrees clockwise would be at (0,0) -> (0,11). Not.\n\nMaybe the rule is to reflect across the center? Let's compute center of grid: coordinates (5.5,5.5). Reflection across center: (r,c) -> (N-1-r, N-1-c). (0,0) -> (11,11). Not.\n\nMaybe the rule is to reflect across the main diagonal but then shift? Wait reflect across main diagonal would keep same coordinates. So not.\n\nMaybe the rule is to rotate 180 degrees? That would map (0,0) -> (11,11). Not.\n\nMaybe the rule is to shift each shape along a diagonal to the other side? Let's analyze the 2's.\n\nInput 2's: They are 2x2 blocks at positions: (1,0),(1,1); (3,2),(3,3); (5,4),(5,5); (7,6),(7,7); (9,8),(9,9); (11,10),(11,11). Output 2's: They are at positions: (1,10),(1,11); (3,8),(3,9); (5,6),(5,7); (7,4),(7,5); (9,2),(9,3); (11,0),(11,1). So basically each 2 block moved along same diagonal to the line row+col=11? Let's check: For block at (1,0)-(1,1), row+col of top-left cell (1,0) is 1. In output, top-left of block is (1,10). Row+col=11. So yes, each 2 block moved to row+col=11. For block at (3,2),(3,3), row+col=5. Output top-left (3,8),(3,9) row+col=11. So yes.\n\nThus the transformation: For each shape of a given color, shift it along the diagonal to a new diagonal where row+col is constant (maybe the largest possible?).\n\nBut why row+col=10 for 8's and row+col=11 for 2's? Let's compute: Input 8's row+col=0,4,8,12,16,20? Wait row+col for input 8's: (0,0) -> 0; (2,2) -> 4; (4,4) -> 8; (6,6) -> 12; (8,8) -> 16; (10,10) -> 20. Output 8's row+col=10 each. So all 8's moved to row+col=10. Input 2's row+col for top-left of each block: (1,0)->1; (3,2)->5; (5,4)->9; (7,6)->13; (9,8)->17; (11,10)->21. Output row+col=11 each. So 2's moved to row+col=11.\n\nSo each color's shapes moved to a diagonal with constant row+col equal to some value. Which value? For 8's, maybe the average of input diagonals? But 0,4,8,12,16,20 average 10. For 2's, average of 1,5,9,13,17,21 average 10? Wait 1+5+9+13+17+21 = 66, average 11. So indeed each color moved to the average row+col of its input shapes. So maybe the rule: For each color, compute the average of row+col of all its non-zero cells (or of its shape's top-left maybe). Then move all cells of that color to that row+col constant line.\n\nBut we need to confirm with Example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input: 12x12 grid again. Colors: 2,3. Let's analyze.\n\nInput Example 2:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo pattern: 2's form 2x2 blocks offset along diagonal. 3's appear as 2x1 or 1x2? Wait check: In row 0, col 10-11: 2 2. Row 1, col 10: 3, col 11: 2. Row 2: col 8-9: 2 2. Row 3: col 8: 3, col 9: 2. Row 4: col 6-7: 2 2. Row 5: col 6: 3, col 7: 2. Row 6: col 4-5: 2 2. Row 7: col 4: 3, col 5: 2. Row 8: col 2-3: 2 2. Row 9: col 2: 3, col 3: 2. Row 10: col 0-1: 2 2. Row 11: col 0: 3, col 1: 2.\n\nSo pattern: 2's appear as 2x2 blocks with top-left at (0,10), (2,8), (4,6), (6,4), (8,2), (10,0). 3's appear adjacent to each block at leftmost column of block? Actually each block has a 3 left of the block's leftmost column? Let's examine: For block at (0,10)-(0,11),(1,10)-(1,11) maybe? Actually block at (0,10)-(1,11)? Wait we need to define shape. Let's examine more precisely.\n\nWe have 2's at positions:\n\n- (0,10),(0,11),(1,11)?? Wait row 1 col 11 is 2. So block at top-left (0,10) includes (0,10),(0,11),(1,10),(1,11)? But row 1 col 10 is 3, not 2. So block is not a 2x2? Let's list all 2 coordinates:\n\nRow 0: (0,10),(0,11)\nRow 1: (1,11)\nRow 2: (2,8),(2,9)\nRow 3: (3,9)\nRow 4: (4,6),(4,7)\nRow 5: (5,7)\nRow 6: (6,4),(6,5)\nRow 7: (7,5)\nRow 8: (8,2),(8,3)\nRow 9: (9,3)\nRow 10: (10,0),(10,1)\nRow 11: (11,1)\n\nWait also (1,10) is 3. (3,8) is 3. (5,6) is 3. (7,4) is 3. (9,2) is 3. (11,0) is 3.\n\nSo pattern: 2's form L-shaped patterns: 2 cells horizontally at top row of each block (except maybe some). Let's analyze: At top-left of each block: For block starting at (0,10), we have 2's at (0,10),(0,11). Then at (1,11) there is a 2. So shape is a 3-cell L: two horizontally at top row, one below rightmost cell. That forms a 2x2 block with missing top-left cell replaced by 3. Similarly at (2,8),(2,9) horizontal, then (3,9) below rightmost. So each 2 block is a 2x2 missing top-left cell. So shape of 2's is a 2x2 block with one cell missing (top-left). 3's occupy that missing cell: at (1,10),(3,8),(5,6),(7,4),(9,2),(11,0). So each 3 is adjacent left of the 2's block.\n\nThus pattern: Each pair of colors 2 and 3 form a 2x2 block where 3 occupies top-left cell, 2 occupies the other three cells: top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right? Wait bottom-left is (1,10)? Actually bottom-left cell of block would be (1,10) but that's 3. So maybe the block is oriented differently. Let's analyze: For block at top-left (0,10), cells: (0,10),(0,11),(1,10),(1,11). 2's are at (0,10),(0,11),(1,11). 3 at (1,10). So 3 is bottom-left cell. So the shape is a 2x2 block with 3 at bottom-left, 2 at the other three cells. So each pair of 2 and 3 forms a 2x2 block where 3 is bottom-left, 2's occupy rest.\n\nNow, output Example 2:\n\nOutput grid:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2\n\nObserving: The output pattern is basically the same as input but mirrored across the main diagonal? Wait let's check: Input had 2's at right side of grid, near columns 10-11. Output has 2's at left side near columns 0-1. So the 2's moved leftwards along a diagonal? Let's analyze coordinates.\n\nInput 2's coordinates: (0,10),(0,11),(1,11),(2,8),(2,9),(3,9),(4,6),(4,7),(5,7),(6,4),(6,5),(7,5),(8,2),(8,3),(9,3),(10,0),(10,1),(11,1). Output 2's coordinates: (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,5),(6,6),(6,7),(7,7),(8,8),(8,9),(9,9),(10,10),(10,11),(11,11). Wait output 2's coordinates: Let's list them:\n\nRow 0: 2 at (0,0),(0,1)\nRow 1: 2 at (1,1)\nRow 2: 2 at (2,2),(2,3)\nRow 3: 2 at (3,3)\nRow 4: 2 at (4,4),(4,5)\nRow 5: 2 at (5,5)\nRow 6: 2 at (6,6),(6,7)\nRow 7: 2 at (7,7)\nRow 8: 2 at (8,8),(8,9)\nRow 9: 2 at (9,9)\nRow 10: 2 at (10,10),(10,11)\nRow 11: 2 at (11,11)\n\nSo indeed each block is a 2x2 missing top-left cell, located at left side. The shape orientation: 3 at top-left of each block? Let's check 3's output: (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). So 3's are at (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). So each 3 is at top-left of each 2x2 block. Wait for block at (0,0)-(1,1), 3 at (1,0) is bottom-left. So orientation: 3 at bottom-left again. So pattern similar: 3 at bottom-left of each 2x2 block, 2 at the other three cells.\n\nThus the transformation: For each pair of colors 2 and 3, they form a 2x2 block where 3 is bottom-left and 2's occupy rest. In input, these blocks were located at the top-right side of grid (columns 10-11). In output, they moved to bottom-left side (columns 0-1). But more precisely, they moved along a diagonal to the opposite side.\n\nLet's examine row+col for 2's. Input 2's row+col: For block at (0,10),(0,11),(1,11) -> row+col for cells: (0,10)=10, (0,11)=11, (1,11)=12. So 2's not all same row+col. But the block as a whole maybe has a constant row+col for its center? Let's analyze each block's top-left coordinate: For block at (0,10), top-left cell is (0,10). For block at (2,8), top-left is (2,8). For block at (4,6), top-left is (4,6). For block at (6,4), top-left is (6,4). For block at (8,2), top-left is (8,2). For block at (10,0), top-left is (10,0). So top-left coordinates row+col: 10,10,10,10,10,10. So all top-left cells have row+col=10. Similarly, 3's positions: (1,10),(3,8),(5,6),(7,4),(9,2),(11,0). Row+col for 3's: 11,11,11,11,11,11. So 3's row+col constant 11. So 3's are at row+col=11. So the transformation for 3's: they moved to row+col=11. For 2's: they moved to row+col=10? Wait in input, 2's had top-left row+col=10. In output, 2's top-left row+col=10. So 2's didn't change row+col. But 3's changed from row+col=?? Let's compute input 3's row+col: (1,10)=11, (3,8)=11, (5,6)=11, (7,4)=11, (9,2)=11, (11,0)=11. So 3's row+col also 11. So 3's didn't change either. Wait both 2 and 3 had constant row+col (10 for 2's top-left, 11 for 3's). But in output, 2's top-left row+col=10, 3's row+col=?? Let's compute output 3's row+col: (1,0)=1, (3,2)=5, (5,4)=9, (7,6)=13, (9,8)=17, (11,10)=21. So output 3's row+col vary: 1,5,9,13,17,21. So 3's moved along a diagonal to row+col varying by 4 increments. Wait 3's moved to positions where row+col = 1,5,9,13,17,21. That's basically row+col = 1 + 4k. In input, 3's had row+col = 11. So they moved to a different diagonal line: row+col = 1+4k. Actually 1,5,9,13,17,21. That is 1,5,9,13,17,21. That's 1+4k for k=0..5. So the 3's moved to a diagonal line that passes through (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). So basically the 3's moved from row+col=11 to row+col=1+4k? Wait row+col=1+4k means slope -1 diagonal offset by 1. The line passes through (1,0) where row+col=1. The line also passes through (11,10) where row+col=21. So it's the line row+col = 1 mod 4? Actually 1+4k. So maybe the rule is to shift each color along the diagonal such that the shape is moved to a new diagonal that is perpendicular to the original? But let's analyze Example 1 again: 8's originally had row+col varying: 0,4,8,12,16,20. They moved to row+col=10. So they moved to a constant row+col. Similarly, 2's originally had row+col: 1,5,9,13,17,21. They moved to row+col=11. So for each color, the output diagonal had constant row+col equal to the average of input row+col values? Let's compute averages: For 8's, average row+col = (0+4+8+12+16+20)/6 = 60/6=10. Yes. For 2's, average row+col = (1+5+9+13+17+21)/6 = 66/6=11. Yes. So output diagonal constant row+col equal to the average of input row+col values for that color.\n\nNow check Example 3: Input Example 3 grid 10x10. Colors: 2,1. Let's analyze.\n\nInput Example 3:\n\nRow 0: 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n\nSo pattern: 2's and 1's arranged along diagonal. Each 2 is adjacent to a 1 forming a 2x2 block? Let's analyze each 2 and 1 arrangement.\n\nAt (0,0) 2, (0,1) 1, (1,0) 1. So there is a 2 at top-left of 2x2 block? Actually 2 at (0,0) and 1's at (0,1) and (1,0). So 1 at top-right and bottom-left. The block missing bottom-right (1,1) is 0. So 2 is at top-left, 1 at top-right and bottom-left.\n\nNext 2 at (2,2), 1 at (2,3),(3,2). So again 2 at top-left, 1's at top-right and bottom-left.\n\nNext 2 at (4,4), 1 at (4,5),(5,4).\n\nNext 2 at (6,6), 1 at (6,7),(7,6).\n\nNext 2 at (8,8), 1 at (8,9),(9,8).\n\nSo pattern: For each 2, there are two 1's adjacent to it at right and bottom. So 2 at top-left of 2x2 block, 1's at top-right and bottom-left.\n\nNow output Example 3:\n\nOutput grid:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo output 2's coordinates: (0,8),(2,6),(4,4),(6,2),(8,0). Wait also (0,8),(2,6),(4,4),(6,2),(8,0). So 2's moved along a diagonal from (8,0) to (0,8). Row+col for each 2: (0,8)=8, (2,6)=8, (4,4)=8, (6,2)=8, (8,0)=8. So all 2's now have row+col=8. Input 2's row+col: (0,0)=0, (2,2)=4, (4,4)=8, (6,6)=12, (8,8)=16. Average row+col = (0+4+8+12+16)/5=40/5=8. Yes. So 2's moved to diagonal with row+col=8.\n\nNow 1's output coordinates: (0,9),(1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3),(7,2),(8,1),(9,0). Actually check: Output grid shows 1's at (0,9),(1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3),(7,2),(8,1),(9,0). Row+col for each 1: 9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9. So all 1's row+col=9. Input 1's row+col: (0,1)=1, (1,0)=1, (2,3)=5, (3,2)=5, (4,5)=9, (5,4)=9, (6,7)=13, (7,6)=13, (8,9)=17, (9,8)=17. Average row+col = (1+1+5+5+9+9+13+13+17+17)/10 = 90/10=9. Yes. So 1's moved to diagonal row+col=9.\n\nThus the transformation rule appears to be:\n\n- For each color (non-zero), compute the average of row+col of all its cells in the input. (We can treat each cell individually, not just shape's top-left; but in these examples, all cells of a color had row+col values that average to a constant, but not necessarily same for each cell? Let's verify for 2's in Example 1: 2's cells row+col values: (1,0)=1, (1,1)=2, (3,2)=5, (3,3)=6, (5,4)=9, (5,5)=10, (7,6)=13, (7,7)=14, (9,8)=17, (9,9)=18, (11,10)=21, (11,11)=22. Sum=1+2+5+6+9+10+13+14+17+18+21+22=?? Let's compute: 1+2=3, +5=8, +6=14, +9=23, +10=33, +13=46, +14=60, +17=77, +18=95, +21=116, +22=138. Average=138/12=11.5. Wait but earlier we said average 11? Let's recalc. Actually maybe we considered top-left only earlier. But if we include all cells, average is 11.5. But output 2's row+col=11. So maybe the rule uses the average of top-left coordinates of each shape? But in Example 1, each shape is a 2x2 block; top-left coordinates: (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). Row+col for these: 1,5,9,13,17,21. Average=66/6=11. So 2's average row+col is 11. Output 2's row+col=11. So the rule uses the average of the top-left coordinates of each shape, not all cells. Similarly for 8's: Each 8 is a single cell; top-left coordinate same as cell coordinate. So average row+col=10. Output 8's row+col=10. So rule: For each shape of a given color, compute the average of the top-left coordinates of the shapes. Then move all shapes of that color to a new diagonal where row+col equals that average. But we need to verify that for Example 2: For 2's shapes: shapes are 2x2 missing top-left? Wait each 2 shape is 3 cells (L shape). But the shape's top-left coordinate? Let's define shape's bounding box. For 2's shape at block (0,10)-(1,11) missing top-left? Actually shape's bounding box includes cells (0,10),(0,11),(1,11). The top-left coordinate of bounding box is (0,10). So top-left coordinates of each 2 shape: (0,10),(2,8),(4,6),(6,4),(8,2),(10,0). Row+col: 10,10,10,10,10,10. Average=10. Output 2 shapes top-left coordinates: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). Row+col=0+0=0, 2+2=4, 4+4=8, 6+6=12, 8+8=16, 10+10=20. Average=0+4+8+12+16+20=60/6=10. Yes. So 2 shapes moved to new positions with top-left row+col=10. Good.\n\nFor 3's shapes: each shape is a single cell at (1,10),(3,8),(5,6),(7,4),(9,2),(11,0). Top-left coordinate same as cell. Row+col: 11,11,11,11,11,11. Average=11. Output 3 shapes top-left coordinates: (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). Row+col: 1,5,9,13,17,21. Average=66/6=11. So 3 shapes moved to new positions with top-left row+col=11. Yes.\n\nThus rule: For each color, compute the average of the top-left coordinates of its shapes (maybe each shape's bounding box). Then reposition each shape of that color such that its top-left coordinate lies on a diagonal line where row+col equals that average (rounded? maybe integer). But the average might not be integer. In Example 1, for 2's shapes, average row+col=11 (integer). For 8's shapes, average row+col=10 (integer). In Example 2, 2's average row+col=10, 3's average row+col=11. In Example 3, 2's average row+col=8, 1's average row+col=9. So all averages are integers. But we need to confirm that average of top-left row+col always integer? Let's compute for Example 1 8's: each shape is a single cell. Top-left coordinates: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). Row+col: 0,4,8,12,16,20. Sum=60, average=10. Good. For 2's: top-left coordinates as above average=11. Good. For Example 2: 2's average=10, 3's average=11. For Example 3: 2's average=8, 1's average=9.\n\nThus rule: For each color, compute average of top-left coordinates of its shapes. Then reposition each shape such that its top-left coordinate lies on the diagonal row+col=average. The shapes maintain their internal arrangement relative to their top-left coordinate. That seems to match all examples.\n\nWe need to confirm that shapes maintain orientation. For 2's shapes, orientation is same: they are 3-cell L shapes with missing top-left cell. In input, they were located at top-right side of grid. In output, they moved to left side but orientation same: the missing top-left cell remains at bottom-left of the shape? Wait orientation: In input, shape at (0,10) had missing top-left cell? Actually shape's bounding box top-left is (0,10). But shape's cells: (0,10),(0,11),(1,11). So missing cell at (1,10). So shape orientation: top-left cell missing? Wait missing top-left cell of bounding box? Actually bounding box top-left is (0,10). But shape's cells: (0,10),(0,11),(1,11). So missing cell at (1,10). So shape orientation: missing bottom-left cell? Wait bounding box top-left is (0,10). The missing cell at (1,10) is bottom-left of bounding box. So shape orientation: missing bottom-left cell. In output, shape at (0,0) has cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,1). Missing bottom-left cell at (1,0). So orientation preserved. Good.\n\nFor 3's shapes: input shape at (1,10) had cells (1,10). In output shape at (1,0) had cell (1,0). So orientation preserved.\n\nFor Example 3: 2's shape at (0,0) had cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0). Missing bottom-right cell. In output shape at (8,0) has cells (8,0),(8,1),(9,0). Missing bottom-right cell. Orientation preserved.\n\nThus rule: reposition shapes along the diagonal line row+col=average (top-left coordinates). The shape's orientation relative to its top-left remains same.\n\nNow we need to apply this rule to the test input.\n\nTest Input: 14x14 grid? Let's check dimensions. Provided grid has 14 columns? Let's count: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8\" that's 14 columns. So grid is 14x14. Colors: 1 and 8. We need to identify shapes for each color.\n\nWe need to parse input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 13: 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo it's a 14x14 grid. Colors: 1 and 8. They appear in a diagonal pattern similar to previous examples. Let's analyze shapes.\n\nWe see pattern: At each step, there's a 2-cell pattern: 1 and 8 adjacent? Let's see: At row 0, col 12 is 1, col 13 is 8. So a 1-8 pair horizontally. At row 1, col 12 is 8, col 13 is 1. So reversed orientation. At row 2, col 10 is 1, col 11 is 8. At row 3, col 10 is 8, col 11 is 1. At row 4, col 8 is 1, col 9 is 8. At row 5, col 8 is 8, col 9 is 1. At row 6, col 6 is 1, col 7 is 8. At row 7, col 6 is 8, col 7 is 1. At row 8, col 4 is 1, col 5 is 8. At row 9, col 4 is 8, col 5 is 1. At row 10, col 2 is 1, col 3 is 8. At row 11, col 2 is 8, col 3 is 1. At row 12, col 0 is 1, col 1 is 8. At row 13, col 0 is 8, col 1 is 1.\n\nSo the pattern is a diagonal of 1-8 pairs, alternating orientation. Each pair is a 2-cell horizontal shape (two adjacent cells). They alternate orientation: first row 0: 1-8 (1 left, 8 right). Row 1: 8-1 (8 left, 1 right). Row 2: 1-8. Row 3: 8-1. So it's a zigzag pattern.\n\nSo we have shapes of color 1 and 8. But we need to identify shapes per color. Each shape is a single cell? Actually each color appears as part of a 2-cell shape. For color 1, each shape consists of one cell? Wait color 1 appears in each pair. But we need to identify shapes for each color separately. In previous examples, shapes of a color were separate clusters (like 2x2 blocks). For 1 and 8, each color appears as separate cells, but they are part of pairs. Are they considered separate shapes? We need to examine the rule: For each color, we compute average of top-left coordinates of its shapes. In previous examples, shapes of a color were multiple shapes (like 6 shapes of 8, 6 shapes of 2). For 1 and 8, each shape is just a single cell? But we need to determine if shapes of color 1 are separate shapes or part of shapes with 8? Let's examine the pattern: Each pair of 1 and 8 are adjacent horizontally. Are they considered separate shapes? In previous examples, shapes of different colors were separate shapes: e.g., 8's shapes were single cells; 2's shapes were 2x2 blocks. They didn't share cells. Here, 1 and 8 are adjacent but they belong to different colors. So each color's shapes are separate cells (no adjacency between same color cells). But we might treat each cell as a shape. So each shape of color 1 is a single cell. Similarly each shape of color 8 is a single cell. But we need to consider orientation? The rule might treat each shape's top-left coordinate as the cell itself. But we need to check if shapes of color 1 and 8 are arranged along a diagonal. Let's compute coordinates for each shape.\n\nLet's list all coordinates of color 1:\n\nRow 0 col 12\nRow 1 col 13\nRow 2 col 10\nRow 3 col 11\nRow 4 col 8\nRow 5 col 9\nRow 6 col 6\nRow 7 col 7\nRow 8 col 4\nRow 9 col 5\nRow 10 col 2\nRow 11 col 3\nRow 12 col 0\nRow 13 col 1\n\nSo 14 cells of color 1. They are arranged along a diagonal? Let's compute row+col: 0+12=12, 1+13=14, 2+10=12, 3+11=14, 4+8=12, 5+9=14, 6+6=12, 7+7=14, 8+4=12, 9+5=14, 10+2=12, 11+3=14, 12+0=12, 13+1=14. So alternating row+col values 12 and 14. So not a single diagonal but two alternating diagonals.\n\nNow coordinates of color 8:\n\nRow 0 col 13\nRow 1 col 12\nRow 2 col 11\nRow 3 col 10\nRow 4 col 9\nRow 5 col 8\nRow 6 col 7\nRow 7 col 6\nRow 8 col 5\nRow 9 col 4\nRow 10 col 3\nRow 11 col 2\nRow 12 col 1\nRow 13 col 0\n\nCompute row+col: 0+13=13, 1+12=13, 2+11=13, 3+10=13, 4+9=13, 5+8=13, 6+7=13, 7+6=13, 8+5=13, 9+4=13, 10+3=13, 11+2=13, 12+1=13, 13+0=13. So all 8's have row+col=13. So 8's are on a single diagonal (the main anti-diagonal row+col=13). 1's are on two diagonals: row+col=12 and row+col=14.\n\nBut maybe we need to consider shapes of color 1 as pairs of cells (1-8). But rule uses shapes of a color individually, not combined with other colors. So we treat each color separately.\n\nThus for color 1, we have 14 shapes (each a single cell). For color 8, we have 14 shapes (each a single cell). We need to compute average top-left coordinate for each color. For color 1: top-left coordinate of each shape is the cell itself. So we compute average row and average col separately? Actually earlier we used average of row+col, not separate row and col. But we could also compute average row and average col separately, but the rule we deduced earlier is average of row+col. But we should confirm: In Example 1, average row+col for 8's shapes is 10. But average row is (0+2+4+6+8+10)/6 = 30/6=5. Average col is same 5. So average row+col = 10. So we could compute average row and col separately, then new row+col = average row+average col. That is same as average of row+col. But if shapes have varying row and col differences, average row+col might not be integer. But in our examples it's integer. But we need to confirm if we should compute average of top-left coordinates separately and then reposition shapes accordingly. Let's test with Example 2 for 2's: average row of top-left coordinates: (0+2+4+6+8+10)/6 = 30/6=5. Average col: (10+8+6+4+2+0)/6 = 30/6=5. So average row+col = 10. So same. For 3's: average row: (1+3+5+7+9+11)/6 = 36/6=6. Average col: (10+8+6+4+2+0)/6 = 30/6=5. So average row+col = 11. So same. For Example 3: 2's average row: (0+2+4+6+8)/5 = 20/5=4. Average col: (0+2+4+6+8)/5=4. Row+col average = 8. For 1's: average row: (0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)/10 = 45/10=4.5. Average col: (1+0+3+2+5+4+7+6+9+8)/10 = 45/10=4.5. Row+col average = 9. So same. So rule can be: compute average row and average col separately for each color. Then reposition each shape such that its top-left coordinate lies on the diagonal where row+col = average row+average col. But we also need to maintain shape orientation relative to top-left.\n\nHowever, we need to check if we also need to shift shapes along the diagonal to the average row+col line. But how to reposition shapes? In examples, shapes moved such that their top-left coordinates moved along the diagonal to satisfy new row+col constant. But how to determine the new row+col constant? It is average row+col. But we also need to decide where along the diagonal each shape ends up. In examples, shapes moved to new positions with top-left coordinates such that the shapes are arranged along the diagonal in the same order as original? For example, in Example 1, 8's shapes originally had top-left coordinates (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). They moved to (10,0),(8,2),(6,4),(4,6),(2,8),(0,10). So the order reversed. In Example 2, 2's shapes originally had top-left coordinates (0,10),(2,8),(4,6),(6,4),(8,2),(10,0). They moved to (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). So the order reversed? Actually original order: from top-right to bottom-left. New order: from top-left to bottom-right. So shapes reversed order along diagonal. Similarly for 3's shapes: original order: (1,10),(3,8),(5,6),(7,4),(9,2),(11,0). New order: (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). That is also reversed order along diagonal? Let's check: In input, 3's top-left coordinates row+col=11 constant. They were arranged along the diagonal from (1,10) to (11,0). In output, they are arranged along the diagonal from (1,0) to (11,10). So indeed reversed order along diagonal. For 1's shapes: original top-left coordinates: (0,12),(1,13),(2,10),(3,11),(4,8),(5,9),(6,6),(7,7),(8,4),(9,5),(10,2),(11,3),(12,0),(13,1). These are arranged along two diagonals. But maybe the rule for each color is to shift shapes such that they line up along a diagonal with constant row+col equal to average. But what about relative order along diagonal? We need to see how shapes are repositioned relative to each other. In Example 1, 8's shapes reversed order. In Example 2, 2's shapes reversed order. In Example 3, 2's shapes reversed order? Let's check: Input 2's top-left coordinates: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8). Output 2's top-left coordinates: (8,0),(6,2),(4,4),(2,6),(0,8). So yes, reversed order. 1's shapes: input top-left coordinates: (0,1),(1,0),(2,3),(3,2),(4,5),(5,4),(6,7),(7,6),(8,9),(9,8). Output 1's top-left coordinates: (0,9),(1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3),(7,2),(8,1),(9,0). So reversed order along diagonal. So rule: shapes of each color are arranged along a diagonal line where row+col constant equal to average row+col of that color. The shapes maintain their relative order along that diagonal, but reversed relative to the input. But is it reversed? Let's analyze: In Example 1, for 8's shapes, input order along diagonal from top-left to bottom-right: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). Output order along diagonal from top-left to bottom-right: (0,10),(2,8),(4,6),(6,4),(8,2),(10,0). So shapes reversed order along diagonal (from bottom-left to top-right). So the order is reversed. In Example 2, 2's shapes reversed order along diagonal. In Example 3, 2's shapes reversed order along diagonal. So yes, shapes reversed.\n\nBut why reversed? Maybe because the shapes are moved to the other side of the grid along the diagonal. The rule might be: For each color, compute the average of the top-left coordinates of its shapes. Then reposition each shape such that its top-left coordinate lies on the diagonal row+col=average, but the shapes are arranged in reverse order relative to their original positions along that diagonal. That is, the shape that was originally nearest to the top-left corner moves to the farthest corner along the diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, the rule might be: For each color, reflect the shapes across the line row+col=average. That is, for each shape, compute its relative position along the diagonal, then reflect it across the midpoint of the diagonal. That would reverse the order. Let's test: For 8's shapes in Example 1: The diagonal row+col=10. The shapes originally at positions (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). The midpoint of the diagonal is at (5,5). Reflecting across that line would map (0,0) to (10,10). But output has (10,0) not (10,10). So not reflection across that line. So maybe it's not reflection across the diagonal.\n\nLet's analyze the mapping more precisely.\n\nDefine coordinates (r,c). For each shape of a color, we have a top-left coordinate (r,c). We compute average row+col = s. In output, we want each shape's top-left coordinate to satisfy r'+c' = s. And we want shapes arranged along that diagonal in reverse order relative to input. That means if we sort input shapes by some ordering along the diagonal (like increasing r or c), we need to map them to output positions sorted by the opposite order. But how to compute mapping? In Example 1, input shapes sorted by r ascending: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). Output shapes sorted by r ascending: (0,10),(2,8),(4,6),(6,4),(8,2),(10,0). So indeed output shapes sorted by r ascending are the reverse of input sorted by r ascending. So mapping: For each shape i in sorted input, output shape at position j where j = N-1-i. So shapes reversed along diagonal.\n\nSimilarly for Example 2, 2 shapes: Input sorted by r ascending: (0,10),(2,8),(4,6),(6,4),(8,2),(10,0). Output sorted by r ascending: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). So output shapes are reversed relative to input sorted by r ascending. So yes.\n\nFor 3 shapes: Input sorted by r ascending: (1,10),(3,8),(5,6),(7,4),(9,2),(11,0). Output sorted by r ascending: (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). So reversed.\n\nFor Example 3, 2 shapes: Input sorted by r ascending: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8). Output sorted by r ascending: (0,8),(2,6),(4,4),(6,2),(8,0). So reversed. 1 shapes: Input sorted by r ascending: (0,1),(1,0),(2,3),(3,2),(4,5),(5,4),(6,7),(7,6),(8,9),(9,8). Output sorted by r ascending: (0,9),(1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3),(7,2),(8,1),(9,0). So reversed.\n\nThus the rule: For each color, we compute the average of the top-left coordinates of its shapes. Then we reposition each shape such that its top-left coordinate lies on the diagonal row+col = average. And the shapes are arranged along that diagonal in reverse order relative to the input sorted by row ascending (or by col ascending, whichever). But is there a reason for reversing? Perhaps because the shapes are moved to the other side of the grid along the diagonal, i.e., from one side to the other side. The average row+col constant line might be the \"midpoint\" of the diagonal across which shapes are moved. But the shapes originally are on one side of that line, and output shapes are on the other side. Let's examine Example 1: 8's input shapes had row+col values 0,4,8,12,16,20. The average row+col=10. So half of them have row+col <10 (0,4,8), half >10 (12,16,20). In output, all shapes have row+col=10. So they are moved to the line. But also reversed order along diagonal. Similarly for 2's shapes: input row+col values 1,5,9,13,17,21. Average=11. Output row+col=11. So again shapes moved to the line. But reversed order. So maybe the rule is: For each color, shift each shape such that its top-left coordinate's row+col becomes the average row+col of that color, but also preserve the shape's relative position along the diagonal by mapping each shape's relative distance from the average to the opposite side. But if we only shift row+col to average, we need to decide how to adjust row and col individually. There might be multiple ways to achieve row+col constant. But the rule seems to maintain the shape's orientation relative to the diagonal: the shape's row coordinate remains same relative to its column? Wait for 8's shapes: Input (0,0) -> output (10,0). Row increased by 10, col unchanged. Input (2,2) -> output (8,2). Row increased by 6, col unchanged. Input (4,4) -> output (6,4). Row increased by 2, col unchanged. Input (6,6) -> output (4,6). Row decreased by 2, col unchanged. Input (8,8) -> output (2,8). Row decreased by 6, col unchanged. Input (10,10) -> output (0,10). Row decreased by 10, col unchanged. So for 8's shapes, column remains same, row changes to satisfy row+col=10. So they moved vertically. For 2's shapes: Input (1,0) -> output (1,10). Row unchanged, col increased by 10. Input (3,2) -> output (3,8). Col increased by 6. Input (5,4) -> output (5,6). Col increased by 2. Input (7,6) -> output (7,4). Col decreased by 2. Input (9,8) -> output (9,2). Col decreased by 6. Input (11,10) -> output (11,0). Col decreased by 10. So 2's shapes moved horizontally. So shapes moved along the diagonal but with either vertical or horizontal shift, depending on orientation? Actually 8's shapes moved vertically because they were originally along main diagonal; to move to row+col=10, you can adjust row only (keeping col same). 2's shapes moved horizontally because they were originally along anti-diagonal? Wait 2's shapes originally had top-left coordinates (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). They were along diagonal row+col=1,5,9,13,17,21. They moved to row+col=11. They moved horizontally: row unchanged, col changed. So they moved horizontally to align with the new diagonal. So the rule: For each shape, we adjust either row or column to satisfy row+col=average, while preserving the other coordinate. But which coordinate remains unchanged? It appears that the coordinate that remains unchanged is the one that is constant along the original diagonal? Let's analyze: For 8's shapes, original diagonal was row=col. So along that diagonal, row and col increase together. To move to new diagonal row+col=10, we can adjust row while keeping col constant, or adjust col while keeping row constant. The rule chosen: keep col constant, adjust row. For 2's shapes, original diagonal was row+col=odd values 1,5,...; along that diagonal, row increases by 2 and col increases by 2. But they moved horizontally: keep row constant, adjust col. So they kept row constant (the coordinate that increases along the diagonal? Actually along the original diagonal, both row and col increase. But they chose to keep row constant and adjust col. So why that choice? Maybe because they choose to keep the coordinate that is minimal? Let's analyze: For 8's shapes, col values are 0,2,4,6,8,10. Row values are 0,2,4,6,8,10. They kept col constant. For 2's shapes, row values are 1,3,5,7,9,11. Col values are 0,2,4,6,8,10. They kept row constant. So they kept the coordinate that had a smaller range? But both ranges equal. Or maybe they kept the coordinate that is constant across shapes? But both row and col vary across shapes.\n\nAlternatively, the rule could be: For each color, compute the average row+col. Then for each shape, compute the difference between the shape's current row+col and the average. Then shift shape along the diagonal direction such that the row+col becomes average. But how to shift shape? We can shift either row or col. The rule might be to shift along the axis that moves the shape the shortest distance? But the shift distances differ: For 8's shapes, shifting row changes row by 10,6,2,-2,-6,-10. For 2's shapes, shifting col changes col by 10,6,2,-2,-6,-10. The magnitude of shift is same but along different axis. So maybe the rule chooses to shift along the axis that is currently smaller? But they shift along the axis that is currently constant? Wait for 8's shapes, col values are constant across shapes? No, col values vary. So no.\n\nMaybe the rule: For each shape, if the shape's bounding box is oriented horizontally (i.e., width > height), shift horizontally; if vertical (height > width), shift vertically. For 8's shapes, each shape is a single cell (height=1,width=1). So orientation ambiguous. For 2's shapes, shape is 3 cells L-shaped: width 2, height 2. So orientation ambiguous too. So not that.\n\nMaybe the rule: For each shape, keep the coordinate that is constant across all shapes of that color. But for 8's shapes, there is no constant coordinate. For 2's shapes, row values vary but col values vary too.\n\nLet's examine the orientation of shapes: In Example 1, 8's shapes are single cells, orientation irrelevant. 2's shapes are 2x2 blocks. They moved horizontally. So maybe the rule: For each shape, keep the coordinate that is the same for all shapes? But not.\n\nLet's analyze more systematically. We need to derive a rule that can produce the output for any input like test input.\n\nLet's analyze the mapping from input to output for each color separately, focusing on coordinates.\n\nWe need to find a transformation that maps each shape's top-left coordinate (r,c) to a new coordinate (r',c') such that:\n\n- r'+c' = s, where s = average of r+c across shapes for that color.\n- The shape's orientation relative to its top-left remains same.\n- The mapping from input shapes to output shapes preserves the shape's relative order along the diagonal but reversed.\n\nBut we also need to decide whether to keep row or col constant. In examples, for 8's shapes, col constant; for 2's shapes, row constant; for 1's shapes in Example 3, row constant? Wait check: In Example 3, 1's shapes originally at (0,1),(1,0),(2,3),(3,2),(4,5),(5,4),(6,7),(7,6),(8,9),(9,8). Output shapes at (0,9),(1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3),(7,2),(8,1),(9,0). Compare input vs output: For each shape, the row coordinate stays the same? Let's check: Input (0,1) -> output (0,9). Row unchanged, col changed. Input (1,0) -> output (1,8). Row unchanged. Input (2,3) -> output (2,7). Row unchanged. Input (3,2) -> output (3,6). Row unchanged. Input (4,5) -> output (4,5). Row unchanged. Input (5,4) -> output (5,4). Row unchanged. Input (6,7) -> output (6,3). Row unchanged. Input (7,6) -> output (7,2). Row unchanged. Input (8,9) -> output (8,1). Row unchanged. Input (9,8) -> output (9,0). Row unchanged. So for 1's shapes, row unchanged, col changed. For 2's shapes in Example 3, col unchanged, row changed. So for each color, we keep either row or col constant. For 2's shapes in Example 3, col constant (2,4,6,8,10). For 1's shapes, row constant. So indeed the rule: For each color, keep the coordinate that is constant across shapes? But 2's shapes: col values are 0,2,4,6,8? Wait 2's shapes in Example 3: top-left coordinates: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8). So col values equal row values. So both vary. So no constant. But they chose to keep col constant? Actually for 2's shapes, output top-left coordinates: (8,0),(6,2),(4,4),(2,6),(0,8). Here col values are 0,2,4,6,8. So col unchanged? Wait input col values: 0,2,4,6,8. Output col values: 0,2,4,6,8. So col unchanged. So they kept col constant. Row changed. For 1's shapes, output row values: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Input row values: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So row unchanged. So they kept row constant.\n\nThus rule: For each color, keep the coordinate that is constant across shapes? But there is no constant across shapes. But maybe we keep the coordinate that is \"more vertical\" or \"more horizontal\"? Wait 2's shapes: col values vary; row values vary. But shape orientation: 2's shapes are 2x2 blocks. They have width=2, height=2. So orientation not distinct. 1's shapes: 1's shapes are 2-cell horizontal? Wait 1's shapes in Example 3: Each 1 shape is a single cell? Wait 1's shapes in Example 3: Each 1 appears as a single cell? Actually 1's shapes are part of 2x2 blocks with 2's. But the 1's themselves are single cells. So orientation not distinct.\n\nSo the rule for which coordinate to keep might be based on the shape's orientation relative to the diagonal? Let's analyze: For 2's shapes in Example 1, the shapes were 2x2 blocks oriented vertically? Actually 2x2 blocks are symmetric. But the 2's shapes moved horizontally. For 8's shapes, moved vertically. For 1's shapes in Example 3, moved horizontally. For 2's shapes in Example 3, moved vertically. So maybe the rule: For each color, keep the coordinate that is \"aligned\" with the shape's orientation relative to the diagonal? Let's analyze.\n\nIn Example 1, 8's shapes are single cells. They moved vertically. 2's shapes are 2x2 blocks. They moved horizontally. In Example 2, 2's shapes are L-shaped missing top-left cell. They moved horizontally. 3's shapes are single cells. They moved vertically. In Example 3, 1's shapes are single cells. They moved horizontally. 2's shapes are 2x2 blocks. They moved vertically.\n\nThus pattern: For each color, if the shape is a single cell (or maybe a shape that is not 2x2 block), we move horizontally; if shape is a 2x2 block, we move vertically. But in Example 2, 3's shapes are single cells, they moved vertically. So that fits. In Example 1, 8's shapes are single cells, they moved vertically. Wait that contradicts. In Example 1, 8's shapes are single cells, they moved vertically. So maybe rule: For each color, if shape is single cell, we move vertically; if shape is 2x2 block, we move horizontally. But Example 2: 3's shapes are single cells, they moved vertically. Good. 2's shapes are L-shaped, not 2x2 block. They moved horizontally. So that fits too. Example 3: 1's shapes are single cells, they moved horizontally? Wait they moved horizontally: row unchanged, col changed. That contradicts. So rule fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rule: For each color, keep the coordinate that is constant across shapes? But there is no constant. But maybe we keep the coordinate that is the same for all shapes of that color in the input? Let's examine each color: In Example 1, 8's shapes: col values 0,2,4,6,8,10: not constant. 2's shapes: col values 0,2,4,6,8,10: not constant. So not.\n\nMaybe rule: Keep the coordinate that is the same across shapes in the input's orientation? For 2's shapes in Example 1, the shapes are 2x2 blocks. The top-left coordinate's row and col are both even. But both vary. So not.\n\nLet's analyze transformation more mathematically.\n\nLet us denote for each shape i of color c: top-left coordinate (ri,ci). Let s_c = average of (ri+ci) across shapes of color c. Then we want to map each shape to new top-left coordinate (ri',ci') such that ri'+ci' = s_c. Additionally, we want to preserve the shape's orientation relative to its top-left coordinate. Also, we want to preserve the relative order along the diagonal, but reversed.\n\nThus we need to define mapping from (ri,ci) to (ri',ci').\n\nWe can choose to keep either row or column constant. Let's denote we keep row constant: ri'=ri, ci' = s_c - ri. That ensures ri'+ci' = s_c. Similarly, if we keep column constant: ci'=ci, ri'=s_c - ci. So we have two options.\n\nWhich one to choose? The examples show that sometimes we keep row constant, sometimes column constant. How to decide? Let's analyze patterns:\n\n- Example 1: 8's shapes: keep column constant. 2's shapes: keep row constant.\n- Example 2: 2's shapes: keep row constant? Wait 2's shapes moved horizontally: row unchanged, col changed. So keep row constant. 3's shapes moved vertically: column unchanged, row changed. So keep column constant.\n- Example 3: 1's shapes moved horizontally: row unchanged, col changed. So keep row constant. 2's shapes moved vertically: column unchanged, row changed. So keep column constant.\n\nThus rule: For each color, we keep the coordinate that is the same across shapes? But not.\n\nLet's examine the orientation of each shape relative to the diagonal: For 8's shapes in Example 1: shape is a single cell. The orientation relative to the diagonal is irrelevant. But we choose to keep column constant. For 2's shapes: shape is 2x2 block. The orientation relative to diagonal: the block extends both horizontally and vertically. But we choose to keep row constant. So maybe rule: For shapes that are \"horizontal\" relative to the diagonal? But shape orientation not relevant.\n\nMaybe rule: For each color, keep the coordinate that is \"smaller\" (i.e., the one that has smaller range)? Let's compute range for 8's shapes: row range 0-10, col range 0-10. Both equal. For 2's shapes: row range 1-11, col range 0-10. Both equal. So no.\n\nMaybe rule: Keep the coordinate that is \"odd\" or \"even\"? For 8's shapes, col values are even, row values are even. For 2's shapes, row values are odd, col values are even. In output, 8's shapes kept col constant (even). 2's shapes kept row constant (odd). For 3's shapes: row values odd, col values even. They kept column constant (even). For 1's shapes: row values even? Actually 1's shapes: row values: 0,1,2,3,...,9. Both even and odd. Col values: 1,0,3,2,5,4,7,6,9,8. So col values alternate. They kept row constant (some even, some odd). So not.\n\nMaybe rule: For each color, keep the coordinate that is \"most aligned with the grid orientation\"? But not.\n\nLet's analyze the difference between shapes that moved vertically vs horizontally: For 8's shapes, they moved vertically. For 2's shapes, moved horizontally. For 3's shapes, moved vertically. For 1's shapes, moved horizontally. So maybe rule: For each color, if the shape is more \"vertical\" in the input (i.e., the shape's bounding box height > width), we keep column constant? But shapes are symmetric. But maybe we consider shape orientation relative to the diagonal: The shape's bounding box's orientation relative to the diagonal might determine which coordinate to keep.\n\nLet's analyze the orientation of shapes relative to the diagonal:\n\n- In Example 1, 8's shapes: single cells. They can be considered oriented along any direction. But we might consider that the shape is \"vertical\" because we want to move vertically. But not.\n\n- In Example 1, 2's shapes: 2x2 block. They moved horizontally. So maybe rule: For each color, if the shape is a block (square), we keep the coordinate that is \"vertical\" or \"horizontal\"? But 2x2 block is symmetric.\n\n- In Example 2, 2's shapes: L shape. They moved horizontally. 3's shapes: single cells. They moved vertically.\n\n- In Example 3, 1's shapes: single cells. They moved horizontally. 2's shapes: 2x2 block. They moved vertically.\n\nThus pattern: For each color, if the shape is a single cell, we might keep the coordinate that is \"vertical\" or \"horizontal\" depending on something else. But we need to find a consistent rule.\n\nLet's examine the positions of shapes relative to the diagonal line row+col=constant. For each shape, we can compute the difference between its current row+col and the average s_c. For shapes that have row+col less than s_c, we need to increase row+col to s_c. For shapes with row+col greater than s_c, we need to decrease row+col to s_c. We can achieve this by adjusting either row or column. But we also need to maintain shape orientation relative to top-left.\n\nBut maybe the rule is: For each shape, we adjust the coordinate that is smaller (i.e., the coordinate that is \"behind\" the shape relative to the diagonal). Let's analyze: For 8's shapes: Input (0,0) has row+col=0 < s=10. To reach s, we need to increase row+col by 10. We can increase row by 10 or col by 10 or combination. They chose to increase row by 10, leaving col unchanged. For (10,10) row+col=20 > s. They decreased row by 10, leaving col unchanged. So they always adjusted row, not col. So they kept col constant. For 2's shapes: Input (1,0) row+col=1 < s=11. They increased col by 10, leaving row unchanged. So they kept row constant. For (11,10) row+col=21 > s. They decreased col by 10, leaving row unchanged. So they kept row constant.\n\nThus rule: For each shape, keep the coordinate that is \"smaller\" in the sense of the shape's relative orientation? Wait for 8's shapes, row and col are equal. For (0,0), row=0, col=0. Which coordinate is smaller? Both equal. They chose to keep col constant. For (10,10), row=10, col=10. They kept col constant. So maybe they always keep the column constant for 8's shapes. For 2's shapes, row values are odd, col values are even. For (1,0), row=1>col=0? Actually row>col. They kept row constant. For (11,10), row>col. They kept row constant. So maybe rule: Keep the coordinate that is \"larger\" or \"smaller\"? For 2's shapes, row is larger than col. They kept row constant. For 8's shapes, row=col. So maybe they keep the coordinate that is not smaller? But ambiguous.\n\nLet's check Example 2: For 2's shapes, row values are odd (1,3,5,7,9,11). Col values are even (10,8,6,4,2,0). Row>col. They kept row constant. For 3's shapes, row values are odd (1,3,5,7,9,11). Col values are even (10,8,6,4,2,0). Row>col. They kept col constant. So rule cannot be based on row>col.\n\nMaybe rule: Keep the coordinate that is \"horizontal\" relative to the shape orientation? For shapes that are L-shaped, the missing cell is at bottom-left; the shape extends horizontally to the right and vertically downward. The shape's \"horizontal\" extent is along columns. For 2's shapes, they kept row constant, which is vertical coordinate. So they kept vertical coordinate constant? Wait 2's shapes: shape extends horizontally to the right (two cells in row 0: (0,10),(0,11)), and vertically downward (cell (1,11)). So shape extends horizontally and vertically. They kept row constant, which is vertical coordinate. So they kept vertical coordinate constant. For 3's shapes: shape is a single cell. They kept column constant (horizontal coordinate). So they kept horizontal coordinate constant. For 8's shapes: single cell. They kept column constant. So they kept horizontal coordinate constant. For 2's shapes in Example 1: 2x2 block extends horizontally and vertically. They kept row constant (vertical coordinate). For 1's shapes in Example 3: single cell. They kept row constant (vertical coordinate). Wait 1's shapes in Example 3: They kept row constant, not column. So not consistent.\n\nLet's analyze orientation relative to the diagonal. For shapes along main diagonal (row=col), we might keep column constant (horizontal). For shapes along anti-diagonal (row+col constant), we might keep row constant (vertical). Let's test:\n\n- Example 1: 8's shapes originally along main diagonal (row=col). They kept column constant. 2's shapes originally along anti-diagonal? Wait 2's shapes top-left coordinates: (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). These coordinates satisfy row+col = 1,5,9,13,17,21. They are not on a single diagonal but on multiple diagonals. But the shape as a whole is a 2x2 block. But the top-left coordinates are not on a single diagonal. However, the shape's bounding boxes are along a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right? Wait the top-left coordinates of the 2x2 blocks are at positions (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). These are along a diagonal with slope 1, but offset. They are not on a single diagonal but each pair has row+col=1,5,9,13,17,21. So they are on a line with slope 1 but offset by 1 each time. Actually the line connecting them is not a straight line? Let's check: The vector between successive top-left coordinates: (2,2). So they are on a line with slope 1. So they are on a diagonal line of slope 1 but offset. So the shape's top-left coordinates are on a diagonal line of slope 1. So for 2's shapes, the top-left coordinates are on a diagonal line with slope 1. They kept row constant (vertical). So maybe rule: For shapes whose top-left coordinates are on a diagonal of slope 1, keep row constant. For shapes whose top-left coordinates are on a diagonal of slope -1, keep column constant. Let's test:\n\n- Example 1: 8's shapes top-left coordinates: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). These are on a diagonal of slope 1 (main diagonal). They kept column constant. So for slope 1 diagonal, keep column constant. For 2's shapes: top-left coordinates: (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). These are also on a diagonal of slope 1? Let's check: The slope between (1,0) and (3,2) is (2,2) slope 1. So yes, they are on a diagonal of slope 1 as well. But they kept row constant. That contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe we mis-evaluated slope. Let's compute slope between (1,0) and (3,2): slope (3-1)/(2-0)=2/2=1. So yes slope 1. So both sets of top-left coordinates are on slope 1 diagonals. So rule cannot be based on slope.\n\nLet's examine the shape orientation: For 8's shapes, each shape is a single cell. For 2's shapes, each shape is a 2x2 block. For 3's shapes, each shape is a single cell. For 1's shapes, each shape is a single cell. So maybe rule: For shapes that are \"square\" (2x2 block), keep row constant. For shapes that are \"single cell\" or \"non-square\", keep column constant? But Example 3: 1's shapes are single cells, but they kept row constant, not column. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: For shapes that are \"single cell\" but appear at positions where row+col is odd? Let's check: 8's shapes: row+col values 0,4,8,12,16,20 (even). They kept column constant. 3's shapes: row+col values 11 (odd). They kept column constant. So not.\n\nMaybe rule: For shapes that are \"single cell\" but appear at positions where row is even? 8's shapes: row values 0,2,4,6,8,10 (even). They kept column constant. 3's shapes: row values 1,3,5,7,9,11 (odd). They kept column constant. So both keep column constant. But 1's shapes in Example 3: row values 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. They kept row constant. So rule fails.\n\nLet's analyze shape orientation relative to the diagonal: For 1's shapes in Example 3, the shape is a single cell. But we could think of the shape as part of a 2x2 block with 2's. But shape itself is a single cell. So orientation not defined. So rule cannot rely on shape orientation.\n\nMaybe rule: For each color, keep the coordinate that is \"constant across shapes of the other color\"? Let's test: In Example 1, 8's shapes keep column constant. 2's shapes keep row constant. But 2's shapes row values: 1,3,5,7,9,11. 8's shapes col values: 0,2,4,6,8,10. Not constant across shapes of other color. But maybe we look at the other color's shape orientation? 2's shapes are 2x2 blocks, 8's shapes are single cells. But rule: For each color, keep the coordinate that is the same as the other color's coordinate? No.\n\nLet's analyze the mapping more systematically. For each shape, we have (ri,ci). We compute s_c = average of ri+ci. We want to produce (ri',ci') such that ri'+ci'=s_c. We also want to preserve shape orientation relative to top-left. That means that the relative offsets of the cells within the shape remain the same. So we can shift the shape by some vector (dr,dc) such that new top-left coordinate is (ri+dr, ci+dc). We want to choose (dr,dc) such that (ri+dr)+(ci+dc)=s_c. So dr+dc = s_c - (ri+ci). So we need to choose dr and dc such that dr+dc = delta_i, where delta_i = s_c - (ri+ci). There are many possibilities. We need to choose one that satisfies additional constraints. The examples show that for each shape, either dr=0 or dc=0 (i.e., we adjust only one coordinate). So the rule might be to adjust only one coordinate: either row or column. Which one? Let's analyze which coordinate is changed for each shape across examples:\n\n- Example 1: 8's shapes: dr !=0, dc=0 (row changed). 2's shapes: dr=0, dc !=0 (col changed).\n- Example 2: 2's shapes: dr=0, dc !=0 (col changed). 3's shapes: dr !=0, dc=0 (row changed).\n- Example 3: 1's shapes: dr=0, dc !=0 (col changed). 2's shapes: dr !=0, dc=0 (row changed).\n\nThus for each color, we either keep row constant or keep column constant. Which one? Let's list:\n\nColor 8: keep column constant (dr !=0).\nColor 2: keep row constant (dc !=0).\nColor 3: keep column constant (dr !=0).\nColor 1: keep row constant (dc !=0).\nSo rule: For each color, keep column constant if the shape is \"horizontal\" orientation? Wait 8's shapes are single cells; 3's shapes are single cells; 1's shapes are single cells; 2's shapes are 2x2 blocks or L-shaped. So rule cannot be based on shape orientation.\n\nMaybe rule: For each color, keep column constant if the shape's bounding box width > height? But for 8's shapes width=1,height=1; equal. For 3's shapes width=1,height=1; equal. For 1's shapes width=1,height=1; equal. So not.\n\nMaybe rule: For each color, keep column constant if the shape's bounding box's top-left coordinate's row is even? Let's test: For 8's shapes, row values 0,2,4,6,8,10 (even). Keep column constant. For 3's shapes, row values 1,3,5,7,9,11 (odd). Keep column constant. So no.\n\nMaybe rule: Keep column constant if the shape's bounding box's top-left coordinate's column is even? For 8's shapes, col values 0,2,4,6,8,10 (even). Keep column constant. For 3's shapes, col values 10,8,6,4,2,0 (even). Keep column constant. For 1's shapes, col values 1,0,3,2,5,4,7,6,9,8 (alternating). But they kept row constant. So maybe rule: Keep column constant if col values are all even? For 1's shapes, col values are not all even. So rule holds: For 1's shapes, col values not all even, so keep row constant. For 2's shapes: col values 0,2,4,6,8,10 (even). But they kept row constant. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: Keep column constant if shape's bounding box's top-left coordinate's row+col is odd? For 8's shapes, row+col values 0,4,8,12,16,20 (even). Keep column constant. For 3's shapes, row+col values 11 (odd). Keep column constant. So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: Keep column constant if shape's bounding box's top-left coordinate's row+col is not equal to the average? But all shapes have row+col varying.\n\nLet's analyze the shape's bounding box orientation relative to the diagonal line row+col=s_c. For each shape, we can compute the difference between its top-left coordinate and the center of the diagonal line? But we need to decide which coordinate to keep.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule: For each color, we keep the coordinate that is the same across all shapes of that color in the input. But we saw no constant. However, maybe there is a constant for each color: For color 8, col values are all even? But not constant. For color 2, row values are all odd? Actually row values: 1,3,5,7,9,11 all odd. So maybe keep row constant for color 2. For color 3, row values all odd. But they kept column constant. So no.\n\nMaybe rule: For each color, we keep the coordinate that is the same parity as the average row+col? Let's check: For 8's shapes, s_c=10 (even). Row values: even. Column values: even. So both parity same as s_c. They kept column constant. For 2's shapes, s_c=11 (odd). Row values: odd. Column values: even. They kept row constant (odd). For 3's shapes, s_c=11 (odd). Row values: odd. Column values: even. They kept column constant (even). So rule fails.\n\nMaybe rule: For each color, keep the coordinate that is the same parity as the average of all coordinates? For 8's shapes, row values even, column values even. Keep column constant. For 2's shapes, row odd, column even. Keep row constant. For 3's shapes, row odd, column even. Keep column constant. For 1's shapes, s_c=9 (odd). Row values: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Parities: even, odd, even, odd, even, odd, even, odd, even, odd. Column values: 1,0,3,2,5,4,7,6,9,8. Parities: odd, even, odd, even, odd, even, odd, even, odd, even. So both rows and columns have mixed parity. So rule not.\n\nLet's analyze the shapes of each color: For color 8: single cells. For color 2: 2x2 blocks. For color 3: single cells. For color 1: single cells. So maybe rule: For shapes that are single cells, we keep column constant if the shape's top-left coordinate's row is even? Let's test: For 8's shapes, row values even. Keep column constant. For 3's shapes, row values odd. Keep column constant. So not.\n\nMaybe rule: For shapes that are single cells, we keep column constant if the shape's top-left coordinate's column is even? 8's shapes: col values even. Keep column constant. 3's shapes: col values even. Keep column constant. 1's shapes: col values vary. But they kept row constant. So rule: For shapes that are single cells, if all col values are even, keep column constant. If not, keep row constant. That might hold: For 1's shapes, col values are not all even. So keep row constant. For 8's shapes, col values all even. Keep column constant. For 3's shapes, col values all even. Keep column constant. But what about shapes where col values not all even but row values all odd? That might not hold.\n\nBut we can test with Example 3: 1's shapes col values: 1,0,3,2,5,4,7,6,9,8. Not all even. So keep row constant. Yes.\n\nNow check Example 2: 3's shapes: col values: 10,8,6,4,2,0 all even. Keep column constant. Yes. 2's shapes: col values: 10,8,6,4,2,0 all even. But they kept row constant. So rule fails.\n\nWait 2's shapes in Example 2: col values all even. But they kept row constant. So rule fails.\n\nSo we need a more robust rule.\n\nLet's analyze the orientation of shapes relative to the diagonal line row+col=s_c. For each color, the shapes originally have top-left coordinates at positions that are either on a line of slope 1 or slope -1? Let's compute for each color:\n\nExample 1: 8's shapes top-left coordinates: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). These are on a line of slope 1. 2's shapes top-left coordinates: (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). These are also on a line of slope 1. So both sets are on slope 1 lines. But they moved to row+col=10 and 11 respectively. So the new diagonal is slope -1. So shapes moved from slope 1 to slope -1. So we can think of transformation: reflect across the center? But no.\n\nExample 2: 2's shapes top-left coordinates: (0,10),(2,8),(4,6),(6,4),(8,2),(10,0). These are on a line of slope -1 (descending). 3's shapes top-left coordinates: (1,10),(3,8),(5,6),(7,4),(9,2),(11,0). Also on slope -1. They moved to row+col=10 and 11 respectively. The new diagonal is slope 1? Actually row+col=10 is slope -1? Wait row+col constant is slope -1. So they moved from slope -1 to slope -1? Wait original shapes had row+col varying: For 2's shapes, row+col values: 10,10,10,10,10,10? Let's compute: (0,10) row+col=10, (2,8)=10, (4,6)=10, (6,4)=10, (8,2)=10, (10,0)=10. So all row+col=10. So 2's shapes originally on diagonal row+col=10. 3's shapes: row+col=11 for all. So 3's shapes on diagonal row+col=11. So shapes originally on slope -1 diagonals. They moved to new diagonals row+col=10 and 11 respectively. Wait 2's shapes originally on row+col=10. They moved to row+col=10 again. So no change. But we saw earlier that they moved horizontally. Actually they moved horizontally: row unchanged, col changed. So their top-left coordinates changed but row+col remained 10. So they moved along the same diagonal. So shape orientation changed? Wait they moved horizontally but stayed on same diagonal? Let's check: Input 2's shapes: (0,10),(2,8),(4,6),(6,4),(8,2),(10,0). Output 2's shapes: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). These are also on row+col=10. So they moved along the same diagonal but reversed order. So they moved from one side of the diagonal to the other side? Actually the diagonal row+col=10 passes through (0,10),(1,9),(2,8),(3,7),(4,6),(5,5),(6,4),(7,3),(8,2),(9,1),(10,0). The input shapes are at positions (0,10),(2,8),(4,6),(6,4),(8,2),(10,0) - basically at every other cell along the diagonal, skipping the ones at (1,9),(3,7),(5,5),(7,3),(9,1). The output shapes are at positions (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10) - these are also along the same diagonal? Wait row+col=10? (0,0) row+col=0, not 10. So output shapes are not on same diagonal. So 2's shapes moved to a different diagonal. Let's check: Output 2's shapes row+col: (0,0)=0, (2,2)=4, (4,4)=8, (6,6)=12, (8,8)=16, (10,10)=20. So they moved to a diagonal row+col=some varying values, not constant. So they moved from row+col=10 to row+col varying. But the rule we derived earlier was that shapes moved to a diagonal with constant row+col equal to the average of original row+col. But for 2's shapes in Example 2, the average row+col is 10. But output shapes row+col vary. Wait we earlier computed that for 2's shapes, average row+col=10. But output shapes row+col vary: 0,4,8,12,16,20. So average row+col of output shapes is 10? Let's compute: Sum 0+4+8+12+16+20=60, average=10. Yes. So average row+col of output shapes is also 10. So shapes moved to a diagonal line? But not constant row+col. They moved along a line of slope 1? Wait output shapes coordinates: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). These are on a line of slope 1 (main diagonal). So output shapes moved to the main diagonal row=col. So the new diagonal is slope 1. So for 2's shapes, they moved from slope -1 diagonal to slope 1 diagonal. For 3's shapes, they moved from slope -1 diagonal to slope 1 diagonal? Let's check: Input 3's shapes: (1,10),(3,8),(5,6),(7,4),(9,2),(11,0). These are on slope -1 diagonal row+col=11. Output 3's shapes: (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). These are also on slope 1 diagonal? Let's check: (1,0) row+col=1, not constant. But are they on slope 1? They satisfy c = r-1? Actually (1,0) difference 1? (1-0)=1. (3-2)=1, (5-4)=1, (7-6)=1, (9-8)=1, (11-10)=1. So yes, they are on line c = r-1, which is slope 1 (line parallel to main diagonal). So output shapes moved to a line parallel to main diagonal. So for both colors, shapes moved from slope -1 to slope 1. In Example 1, 8's shapes moved from slope 1 to slope -1. 2's shapes moved from slope 1 to slope -1. So in Example 1, shapes moved from slope 1 to slope -1. In Example 2, shapes moved from slope -1 to slope 1. In Example 3, shapes moved from slope 1 to slope -1? Let's check: Input 2's shapes: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8). These are on slope 1. Output 2's shapes: (8,0),(6,2),(4,4),(2,6),(0,8). These are on slope -1? Let's check: (8-0)=8, (6-2)=4, (4-4)=0, (2-6)=-4, (0-8)=-8. So difference decreases by -4 each step. So yes, they are on slope -1. So 2's shapes moved from slope 1 to slope -1. 1's shapes: input (0,1),(1,0),(2,3),(3,2),(4,5),(5,4),(6,7),(7,6),(8,9),(9,8). These are on slope -1? Let's check: difference r-c: (0-1)=-1, (1-0)=1, (2-3)=-1, (3-2)=1, etc. So they alternate. So input 1's shapes are not on a single diagonal, but on two diagonals: one with r-c=-1 (positions (0,1),(2,3),(4,5),(6,7),(8,9)), and one with r-c=1 (positions (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8)). Output 1's shapes: (0,9),(1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3),(7,2),(8,1),(9,0). These are on slope -1? Let's check: r-c: (0-9)=-9, (1-8)=-7, (2-7)=-5, (3-6)=-3, (4-5)=-1, (5-4)=1, (6-3)=3, (7-2)=5, (8-1)=7, (9-0)=9. So r-c increases by 2 each step. So they are on slope 1? Wait difference r-c is not constant, but difference r+c is constant? Let's compute r+c: (0+9)=9, (1+8)=9, (2+7)=9, (3+6)=9, (4+5)=9, (5+4)=9, (6+3)=9, (7+2)=9, (8+1)=9, (9+0)=9. Yes, r+c constant 9. So output 1's shapes are on slope -1 diagonal. Input 1's shapes were on two diagonals: r+c=1 and r+c=5? Wait compute r+c for input 1's shapes: (0,1): 1; (1,0):1; (2,3):5; (3,2):5; (4,5):9; (5,4):9; (6,7):13; (7,6):13; (8,9):17; (9,8):17. So input 1's shapes are on r+c=1,5,9,13,17. Output 1's shapes on r+c=9. So input shapes had r+c varying, output shapes all have r+c constant 9. So shapes moved to a diagonal r+c constant. So we can see a pattern: For each color, shapes moved to a diagonal r+c constant equal to average of their input r+c. The direction of movement (whether they move from slope 1 to slope -1 or vice versa) depends on the original orientation of the shapes? But the shapes moved to a new diagonal r+c constant. The original shapes had varying r+c values (not constant). But in Example 2, 2's shapes had constant r+c=10. So they were originally on a diagonal. But they moved to a new diagonal r+c constant 10? Wait 2's shapes originally had r+c=10 constant. Output shapes have r+c varying. So they moved to a new diagonal r+c constant? Actually output shapes have r+c varying, but they are on a diagonal r-c constant? Wait output 2's shapes: (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). These have r-c=0 constant. So they are on a diagonal r-c constant. So output shapes are on a diagonal r-c constant (slope 1). So the rule might be: For each color, compute average of r+c. Then reposition shapes such that they lie on a diagonal r-c constant equal to something? Let's analyze.\n\nLet's compute for each color:\n\nExample 1:\n- 8's shapes: Input r+c values: 0,4,8,12,16,20. Average r+c = 10. Output r+c values: 10,10,10,10,10,10. So output shapes are on diagonal r+c constant 10. So they moved to a diagonal r+c constant equal to average r+c. Good.\n\n- 2's shapes: Input r+c values: 1,5,9,13,17,21. Average r+c = 11. Output r+c values: 11,11,11,11,11,11. So output shapes on diagonal r+c constant 11.\n\nExample 2:\n- 2's shapes: Input r+c values: all 10. Average r+c = 10. Output r+c values: 0,4,8,12,16,20. Wait output shapes r+c values are 0,4,8,12,16,20. So not constant. So output shapes not on r+c constant. But maybe they are on r-c constant? Let's compute r-c values for output shapes: (0,0) -> 0, (2,2) -> 0, (4,4) -> 0, (6,6) -> 0, (8,8) -> 0, (10,10) -> 0. So output shapes r-c constant 0. So output shapes on diagonal r-c constant 0. So the rule might be: For each color, compute average of r+c. Then reposition shapes such that they lie on a diagonal r-c constant equal to something? But for 2's shapes, average r+c=10, but output r-c constant 0. So not equal.\n\nMaybe the rule: For each color, compute average of r+c. Then reposition shapes such that they lie on a diagonal r-c constant equal to average of r-c? Let's compute average of r-c for 2's shapes in Example 2: Input r-c values: (0-10)=-10, (2-8)=-6, (4-6)=-2, (6-4)=2, (8-2)=6, (10-0)=10. Sum=0. Average=0. Output r-c constant 0. So matches. For 3's shapes: Input r-c values: (1-10)=-9, (3-8)=-5, (5-6)=-1, (7-4)=3, (9-2)=7, (11-0)=11. Sum=0. Average=0. Output r-c constant 0. So both colors in Example 2 have average r-c = 0. So output shapes on r-c constant 0. That matches.\n\nExample 1: 8's shapes input r-c values: (0-0)=0, (2-2)=0, (4-4)=0, (6-6)=0, (8-8)=0, (10-10)=0. Average=0. Output r-c values: (10-0)=10, (8-2)=6, (6-4)=2, (4-6)=-2, (2-8)=-6, (0-10)=-10. Sum=0. Average=0. So output shapes r-c values vary but sum to 0. But output shapes are not on r-c constant. So this rule fails.\n\nLet's examine Example 3: 2's shapes input r+c values: 0,4,8,12,16. Average=8. Output r+c values: 8,8,8,8,8. So output r+c constant 8. Good. 1's shapes input r+c values: 1,1,5,5,9,9,13,13,17,17. Average=9. Output r+c values: 9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9. So output r+c constant 9. Good.\n\nSo for Examples 1 and 3, output shapes on r+c constant equal to average r+c. For Example 2, output shapes on r-c constant equal to average r-c. So rule seems to vary between r+c and r-c depending on something.\n\nLet's analyze the orientation of shapes relative to the diagonal lines: In Example 1, shapes originally had r+c varying. They moved to r+c constant. In Example 3, same. In Example 2, shapes originally had r+c constant. They moved to r-c constant. So rule might be: If shapes originally lie on a diagonal r+c constant, then transform to r-c constant (i.e., move to the other diagonal orientation). If shapes originally lie on a diagonal r-c constant, then transform to r+c constant. But in Example 2, 2's shapes had r+c constant 10. They moved to r-c constant 0. 3's shapes had r+c constant 11. They moved to r-c constant 0. So yes, they moved to r-c constant.\n\nIn Example 1, 8's shapes had r+c varying (0,4,8,12,16,20). 2's shapes had r+c varying (1,5,9,13,17,21). So they moved to r+c constant. So rule: If shapes originally have r+c varying, move to r+c constant. If shapes originally have r+c constant, move to r-c constant. But we also need to compute the constant value. For r+c constant case, constant is average r+c. For r-c constant case, constant is average r-c. Let's test with Example 2: 2's shapes r+c constant 10, average r-c = 0. Output r-c constant 0. Yes. 3's shapes r+c constant 11, average r-c = 0. Output r-c constant 0. Yes.\n\nNow we need to verify with Example 1: 8's shapes r+c varying, average r+c = 10. Output r+c constant 10. Good. 2's shapes r+c varying, average r+c = 11. Output r+c constant 11. Good.\n\nExample 3: 2's shapes r+c varying, average r+c = 8. Output r+c constant 8. Good. 1's shapes r+c varying, average r+c = 9. Output r+c constant 9. Good.\n\nThus rule: For each color, determine whether the shapes' top-left coordinates have varying r+c or constant r+c. If varying, shift shapes such that their top-left coordinates lie on a diagonal with constant r+c equal to the average r+c of the shapes. If constant, shift shapes such that their top-left coordinates lie on a diagonal with constant r-c equal to the average r-c of the shapes.\n\nAdditionally, we need to decide which coordinate to keep constant: For varying r+c case, we keep either row or column constant? In examples, for varying r+c case, we kept column constant for 8's shapes and 1's shapes? Wait 8's shapes: varying r+c, we kept column constant. 1's shapes: varying r+c, we kept row constant. So not consistent. For varying r+c, we might keep the coordinate that is constant across shapes of the other color? Let's check: In Example 1, 8's shapes varying r+c, 2's shapes varying r+c. For 8's shapes, column constant? Wait 8's shapes column values vary. For 1's shapes, row constant? But 1's shapes row values vary. So not.\n\nMaybe we need to decide which coordinate to keep based on the shape's orientation relative to the diagonal? Let's analyze the shapes of varying r+c case:\n\nExample 1: 8's shapes: single cells. 2's shapes: 2x2 blocks. In output, 8's shapes moved vertically (row changed), 2's shapes moved horizontally (col changed). So for 8's shapes, we kept column constant; for 2's shapes, we kept row constant.\n\nExample 3: 2's shapes: 2x2 blocks. 1's shapes: single cells. Output: 2's shapes moved vertically (row changed), 1's shapes moved horizontally (col changed). So pattern: For 2x2 blocks, keep row constant (move vertically). For single cells, keep column constant (move horizontally). Wait in Example 3, 1's shapes moved horizontally: row constant, col changed. That matches \"single cells keep column constant\"? Wait we said keep column constant means col unchanged. But 1's shapes moved horizontally: row constant, col changed. So that means they kept row constant, not column constant. So that contradicts.\n\nWait maybe we mis-saw: In Example 3, 1's shapes moved horizontally: row constant, col changed. So they kept row constant. So for single cells, they kept row constant. In Example 1, 8's shapes are single cells, but they kept column constant. So not consistent.\n\nLet's examine orientation of shapes relative to the diagonal: For 8's shapes, they are single cells on main diagonal. For 1's shapes, they are single cells on two diagonals? But still single cells. So no.\n\nMaybe rule: For each color, keep the coordinate that is \"even\" or \"odd\"? Let's check: For 8's shapes, col values are even. They kept column constant. For 1's shapes, row values are even and odd. They kept row constant. For 2's shapes, row values are odd, col values even. They kept row constant. For 3's shapes, row values odd, col values even. They kept column constant. So rule: If the shape's top-left coordinate's row parity is odd, keep row constant? Let's test: For 2's shapes: row values odd, keep row constant. For 3's shapes: row values odd, but they kept column constant. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: Keep the coordinate that is the same across shapes of that color? But we saw no constant.\n\nLet's analyze the mapping from input to output coordinates more precisely. For each shape i, we have (ri,ci). We want to compute (ri',ci') such that:\n\n- For varying r+c case: r'+c' = s (average r+c). And we want to preserve shape orientation. Also we want to preserve the relative order along the diagonal: shapes reversed. But we also need to decide whether to keep row or column constant. The examples show that for varying r+c case, we keep the coordinate that is \"aligned\" with the shape's orientation relative to the diagonal? But shape orientation ambiguous.\n\nMaybe we can derive a formula for (ri',ci') that uses both ri and ci. For example, we might set ri' = ri, ci' = s - ri. That keeps row constant. Or ci' = ci, ri' = s - ci. That keeps column constant. We need to decide which one to use. We might choose based on whether ri <= ci or something. Let's test: For 8's shapes: ri <= ci? For 8's shapes, ri=ci. So ri <= ci holds. But they kept column constant, not row. So rule fails.\n\nAlternatively, choose based on whether ri <= s/2? Let's test: For 8's shapes, s=10. For shape (0,0), ri=0 <= 5, so we keep column constant? That matches. For shape (2,2), ri=2 <=5, keep column constant. For shape (10,10), ri=10 >5, but they still kept column constant. So rule fails.\n\nAlternatively, choose based on whether ci <= s/2? For 8's shapes, ci=ri. So same.\n\nFor 2's shapes: s=11. For shape (1,0), ri=1 <=5, but they kept row constant. So fails.\n\nMaybe rule: Keep row constant if ri <= ci? For 2's shapes, ri>ci? Let's check: (1,0) ri=1>0, keep row constant. (3,2) 3>2, keep row constant. (5,4) 5>4, keep row constant. So rule: keep row constant if ri>ci. For 8's shapes: ri=ci, so ri not > ci. So we keep column constant. That matches. For 3's shapes: ri>ci? For (1,10), 1<10, so ri<ci, so keep column constant. For (3,8), 3<8, keep column constant. So rule: keep row constant if ri>ci, else keep column constant. Let's test with Example 3: 2's shapes: (0,0) 0=0, not >, keep column constant? But we observed they kept column constant? Wait 2's shapes moved vertically, meaning row changed, column constant. So they kept column constant. Yes. For 1's shapes: (0,1) 0<1, keep column constant? But they kept row constant. So rule fails. Wait 1's shapes: (0,1) 0<1, but they kept row constant. So rule fails.\n\nLet's analyze 1's shapes in Example 3: They are single cells. For shape (0,1), ri=0<ci=1. They kept row constant. So rule: keep row constant if ri<ci? That would hold for shape (0,1). For shape (1,0), ri=1>ci=0, but they kept row constant? Wait (1,0) 1>0, but they kept row constant. So rule fails.\n\nLet's examine shape orientation: For 1's shapes, they are part of 2x2 blocks with 2's. But orientation of shape relative to diagonal? The 1's shapes are at top-right and bottom-left positions of the 2x2 block. So shape orientation relative to diagonal might be different. But still shape is single cell.\n\nLet's analyze the transformation mapping for 1's shapes in Example 3: Input (0,1) -> output (0,9). So row unchanged, col changed. Input (1,0) -> output (1,8). Row unchanged, col changed. So they kept row constant. So for 1's shapes, row constant.\n\nFor 2's shapes in Example 3: Input (0,0) -> output (8,0). Row changed, col unchanged. So keep column constant.\n\nSo rule: For shapes that are part of 2x2 blocks (color 2), keep column constant. For shapes that are single cells (color 1), keep row constant. But in Example 1, 8's shapes are single cells, but they kept column constant. So rule fails.\n\nWait maybe we mis-evaluated: In Example 1, 8's shapes are single cells. They kept column constant. So that contradicts rule that single cells keep row constant. So not.\n\nLet's analyze orientation of shapes relative to the diagonal line they moved to: For 8's shapes, they moved vertically to a line with constant r+c. For 2's shapes, they moved horizontally to a line with constant r+c. For 1's shapes in Example 3, they moved horizontally to a line with constant r+c. For 2's shapes in Example 3, they moved vertically to a line with constant r+c. So the pattern seems: For shapes of one color, we keep row constant, move horizontally; for shapes of another color, we keep column constant, move vertically. Which color gets which depends on something else.\n\nLet's analyze the colors and the shape types across examples:\n\nExample 1:\n- Color 8: single cells, moved vertically.\n- Color 2: 2x2 blocks, moved horizontally.\n\nExample 2:\n- Color 2: L-shaped (missing top-left cell), moved horizontally.\n- Color 3: single cells, moved vertically.\n\nExample 3:\n- Color 1: single cells, moved horizontally.\n- Color 2: 2x2 blocks, moved vertically.\n\nSo the mapping of shape type to movement direction is not consistent across examples: sometimes single cells move vertically, sometimes horizontally; sometimes 2x2 blocks move vertically, sometimes horizontally.\n\nLet's examine the colors: In Example 1, 8's shapes moved vertically; in Example 2, 3's shapes moved vertically; in Example 3, 2's shapes moved vertically. So vertical movement color: 8, 3, 2. Horizontal movement color: 2, 1. So vertical movement color seems to be the color that appears in the input on the right side of the diagonal? Wait in Example 1, 8's shapes originally at left side of grid? Actually 8's shapes originally at (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). These are along main diagonal from top-left to bottom-right. 2's shapes originally at positions (1,0),(3,2),(5,4),(7,6),(9,8),(11,10). These are also along diagonal but offset by one cell. So 8's shapes originally at left side of each 2x2 block? Wait 2's shapes are 2x2 blocks covering cells at (1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1)? Actually 2's shapes top-left at (1,0). So shape occupies cells (1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1). So shape extends to right and down. So 8's shapes are at left side of each 2x2 block. So maybe rule: For shapes that are at left side of a block, keep column constant? But 8's shapes are single cells, not part of block. But they are at left side of each block. So maybe rule: For shapes that are left side of a block, keep column constant? But 2's shapes are the block itself, not left side. So not.\n\nLet's analyze the shape positions relative to the other color's shapes: In Example 1, 8's shapes are left of each 2x2 block. In Example 2, 2's shapes are left of each 3 cell? Actually 2's shapes are L shapes with 3 at bottom-left. 3's shapes are at bottom-left of each L shape. So 2's shapes are right of 3's shapes. In Example 3, 1's shapes are at top-right of each 2x2 block. 2's shapes are top-left of each 2x2 block. So 1's shapes are right of 2's shapes. So maybe rule: For each pair of colors, one color's shapes are left or right of the other color's shapes. The color that is left moves vertically; the color that is right moves horizontally. Let's test: Example 1: 8's shapes are left of 2's shapes? Actually 8's shapes at (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8),(10,10). 2's shapes at (1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1)... So 8's shapes are at left side of each 2x2 block. So 8's shapes are left of 2's shapes. In output, 8's shapes moved vertically, 2's shapes moved horizontally. So left color moved vertically, right color moved horizontally. Example 2: 2's shapes: top-left at (0,10),(2,8),(4,6),(6,4),(8,2),(10,0). 3's shapes: at (1,10),(3,8),(5,6),(7,4),(9,2),(11,0). So 3's shapes are below 2's shapes? Actually 3's shapes are bottom-left of each 2 shape. So 2's shapes are above 3's shapes. So 2's shapes are \"top\" relative to 3's shapes. In output, 2's shapes moved horizontally, 3's shapes moved vertically. So top color moved horizontally, bottom color moved vertically. That matches the pattern: one color moves horizontally, the other vertically.\n\nExample 3: 2's shapes: top-left at (0,0),(2,2),(4,4),(6,6),(8,8). 1's shapes: at (0,1),(1,0),(2,3),(3,2),(4,5),(5,4),(6,7),(7,6),(8,9),(9,8). 1's shapes are right of 2's shapes? Let's see: For each 2x2 block, 2's shape is top-left, 1's shape is top-right and bottom-left. So 1's shapes are to the right of 2's shape (top-right) and below (bottom-left). So 1's shapes are not exclusively right or below. But maybe we can consider that 1's shapes are \"right\" of 2's shapes? Actually top-right is to the right, bottom-left is below. But maybe we can consider the primary orientation: For each 2x2 block, 1's shapes are to the right of 2's shape. So 1's shapes are right of 2's shapes. In output, 1's shapes moved horizontally, 2's shapes moved vertically. So right color moved horizontally, left color moved vertically. That matches pattern: left color moves vertically, right color moves horizontally. So rule: Determine relative orientation of the two colors: one color is to the left of the other (or above). Then move the left (or top) color vertically and the right (or bottom) color horizontally. But we need to formalize this.\n\nBut the orientation might be ambiguous: In Example 2, 2's shapes are above 3's shapes. So 2's color moves horizontally, 3's color moves vertically. That matches left-right rule? But 2's shapes above 3's shapes, not left. But we can treat vertical orientation similarly: top color moves horizontally, bottom color moves vertically. So the rule might be: For two colors, the one that is positioned \"above\" or \"left\" relative to the other moves horizontally, while the one that is \"below\" or \"right\" moves vertically. But we need to decide which orientation to use.\n\nLet's analyze the relative positions of colors in each example:\n\nExample 1: 8's shapes at left side of 2's shapes. So 8 is left of 2. So left color moves vertically. 2 moves horizontally.\n\nExample 2: 2's shapes above 3's shapes. So 2 is above 3. So top color moves horizontally. 3 moves vertically.\n\nExample 3: 2's shapes left of 1's shapes? Actually 2's shapes at top-left of 2x2 block. 1's shapes at top-right and bottom-left. So 1's shapes are right of 2's shape (top-right). So 1 is right of 2. So right color moves horizontally. 2 moves vertically.\n\nThus rule: For two",
    "7": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to solve an ARC puzzle. We have three training examples with input grids and outputs. The test input is given. We need to produce output grid.\n\nWe must identify transformation rule.\n\nLet's parse the training examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput grid (5x5):\nRow1: 1 1 0 1 1\nRow2: 1 0 0 0 1\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 1 0 2 2\nRow5: 1 1 0 2 2\n\nOutput grid (2x2):\nRow1: 1 0\nRow2: 1 1\n\nExample 2:\nInput grid (5x5):\nRow1: 1 0 0 1 1\nRow2: 1 1 0 1 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 1 1 0 2 2\nRow5: 0 1 0 2 2\n\nOutput grid (2x2):\nRow1: 0 1\nRow2: 1 1\n\nExample 3:\nInput grid (5x5):\nRow1: 1 1 0 0 1\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 1\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 2 2\nRow5: 1 1 0 2 2\n\nOutput grid (2x2):\nRow1: 1 0\nRow2: 1 0\n\nTest Input:\nRow1: 1 1 0 0 1\nRow2: 0 1 0 1 1\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 1 0 0 2 2\nRow5: 1 1 0 2 2\n\nWe need to output a 2x2 grid. Let's analyze.\n\nObservations: Input grid 5x5, output 2x2. The input contains numbers 0,1,2. The 2's appear in bottom right corner region (rows 4-5, columns 4-5). The 1's appear in left side top area and maybe also some right side. The output grid appears to be a 2x2 pattern derived from some region or shape.\n\nLet's examine each example more closely.\n\nExample 1 Input:\n\nRow1: 1 1 0 1 1\nRow2: 1 0 0 0 1\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 1 0 2 2\nRow5: 1 1 0 2 2\n\nSo 2's are in rows 4-5, columns 4-5: a 2x2 block of 2's at bottom right corner. The 1's form a shape: maybe a cross shape or something. Let's mark coordinates. Coordinates (row, col) starting at 1:\n\nRow1: (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=0, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1\nRow2: (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=0, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=1\nRow3: all 0\nRow4: (4,1)=0, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=2, (4,5)=2\nRow5: (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=2, (5,5)=2\n\nSo the 1's are at positions: (1,1),(1,2),(1,4),(1,5),(2,1),(2,5),(4,2),(5,1),(5,2). That's 9 cells.\n\nOutput grid: 2x2: \nRow1: 1 0\nRow2: 1 1\n\nSo output cells: (1,1)=1, (1,2)=0, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=1.\n\nWhere does that come from? Possibly the shape of 1's relative to 2's? The 2's are a 2x2 block at bottom right. The 1's might be in some shape that is the same shape as output? Maybe the output is the 1's relative to the 2's region? Let's examine the 1's that are adjacent to the 2's region. Which 1's are near the 2's? 2's block at (4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5). The 1's adjacent to that region: (4,2) is left of 2's block but not adjacent horizontally? Actually (4,2) is two columns away from (4,4). (5,1),(5,2) are below-left of 2's block. There's also (2,5) above 2's block but not adjacent. (1,4),(1,5),(2,1),(1,1),(1,2) are far.\n\nMaybe the output grid is a pattern of 1's relative to the 2's block? Let's check Example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n\nRow1: 1 0 0 1 1\nRow2: 1 1 0 1 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 1 1 0 2 2\nRow5: 0 1 0 2 2\n\nSo 2's again in bottom right 2x2 block. 1's positions: (1,1),(1,4),(1,5),(2,1),(2,2),(2,4),(4,1),(4,2),(5,2). Output grid: 2x2: \nRow1: 0 1\nRow2: 1 1\n\nSo output cells: (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=1.\n\nExample 3 Input:\n\nRow1: 1 1 0 0 1\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 1\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 2 2\nRow5: 1 1 0 2 2\n\nSo 2's again bottom right 2x2 block. 1's positions: (1,1),(1,2),(1,5),(2,5),(5,1),(5,2). Output grid: 2x2: \nRow1: 1 0\nRow2: 1 0\n\nOutput cells: (1,1)=1, (1,2)=0, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0.\n\nIt seems output is 2x2 grid that maybe corresponds to some relative arrangement of 1's around the 2's block? Let's examine positions of 1's relative to the 2's block. The 2's block occupies bottom right corner: cells (4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5). So we can think of a 2x2 block as a reference. The output maybe is a representation of which of the 4 cells adjacent to that block (above, left, etc.) contain 1's? But output is 2x2, not 4 cells.\n\nMaybe the output is a 2x2 grid that is the shape of 1's in the region that is above-left of the 2's block? Let's examine the region above-left of the 2's block: rows 1-3, columns 1-3. That is a 3x3 region. But output is 2x2. Maybe we consider the region that is the same shape as the 2's block but offset to where 1's are? For example, maybe we find the bounding box of 1's that is the same shape as the bounding box of 2's, and then produce a 2x2 grid of that shape? But the bounding box of 1's is bigger than 2x2. In Example 1, 1's bounding box is from row1 to row5 (rows 1-5) and col1 to col5 (cols 1-5) basically entire grid except some zeros. But maybe the 1's form a shape that is the same as the shape of 2's? But 2's shape is a 2x2 block. 1's shape is not 2x2.\n\nMaybe the output grid is the pattern of 1's relative to the 2's block, but only for the cells that are directly adjacent to the 2's block? Let's list cells adjacent to the 2's block: The 2's block covers (4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5). Adjacent cells (4-neighbor) would be:\n\n- Above: (3,4),(3,5)\n- Left: (4,3),(5,3)\n- Diagonals? Might include (3,3),(3,6),(4,6),(5,6),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6) but grid is 5x5 so out-of-bounds.\n\nBut maybe we consider 8-neighbor adjacency. Let's list all cells that are adjacent (8-neighbor) to the 2's block: For each of the 4 cells, we consider its neighbors. That yields a set of cells around the block. Let's list them:\n\nNeighbors of (4,4): (3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(4,3),(4,5),(5,3),(5,4),(5,5).\nNeighbors of (4,5): (3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(4,4),(4,6),(5,4),(5,5),(5,6).\nNeighbors of (5,4): (4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,3),(5,5),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5).\nNeighbors of (5,5): (4,4),(4,5),(4,6),(5,4),(5,6),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6).\n\nUnion of all: (3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(4,6),(5,3),(5,4),(5,5),(5,6),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6). Many out-of-bounds. But in grid, we only consider within 1-5 rows/cols. So we get: (3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,3),(5,4),(5,5). That's 9 cells. These correspond to a 3x3 block centered on the 2's block, but missing some corners? Actually it's a 3x3 block covering rows 3-5, cols 3-5: rows 3-5, cols 3-5. That is 3x3 block: cells (3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,3),(5,4),(5,5). So the 2's block is the bottom right 2x2 of that 3x3 block. So maybe we consider that 3x3 block and map the 1's present in that block? Let's check Example 1: The 3x3 block rows 3-5, cols 3-5: Let's list values:\n\nRows 3-5, Cols 3-5:\nRow3: (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0\nRow4: (4,3)=0, (4,4)=2, (4,5)=2\nRow5: (5,3)=0, (5,4)=2, (5,5)=2\n\nSo the 3x3 block has only 2's, no 1's. But output grid is not 3x3. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is the shape of 1's that are in the same positions relative to the 2's block as the 1's are relative to the 2's block in the input. But we need to produce a 2x2 output. So maybe we take the 2x2 block of 1's that are adjacent to the 2's block? Let's examine adjacency by 4-neighbor only: cells directly left, right, above, below of each 2 cell. But 2's block has no cells outside of it? Actually we can consider the cells that are adjacent to the 2's block horizontally and vertically: left side: cells at col3, same rows 4-5: (4,3),(5,3). Right side: col6 out-of-bounds. Above: row3, col4-5: (3,4),(3,5). Below: row6 out-of-bounds. So adjacent cells by 4-neighbor are (4,3),(5,3),(3,4),(3,5). These are 4 cells. Let's see if any of them contain 1's. In Example 1, (4,3)=0, (5,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0. So no 1's. So that doesn't produce output.\n\nMaybe the output is the shape of 1's that are in the same relative positions as the 2's block? That would be 2x2 block of 1's somewhere else. For example, maybe we find a 2x2 block of 1's in the input and output that block? Let's check Example 1: Are there any 2x2 blocks of 1's? Let's search for any 2x2 block of 1's. In Example 1, 1's positions: (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(4,2),(5,1),(5,2),(1,4),(1,5),(2,5). Let's check each 2x2 block:\n\n- (1,1)-(2,2): cells (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0. So not all 1's.\n\n- (1,4)-(2,5): cells (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=1. Not all 1's.\n\n- (4,1)-(5,2): cells (4,1)=0,(4,2)=1,(5,1)=1,(5,2)=1. Not all 1's.\n\n- (5,1)-(6,2): out-of-bounds.\n\n- (5,2)-(6,3): out-of-bounds.\n\n- (4,2)-(5,3): cells (4,2)=1,(4,3)=0,(5,2)=1,(5,3)=0. Not all 1's.\n\nSo no 2x2 block of 1's. But output is 2x2 with some 1's. So maybe we are to produce a 2x2 pattern of 1's that is the \"difference\" between the 1's pattern and something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is the pattern of 1's that are \"inside\" the shape formed by the 1's and 2's? But output is small.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between input and output more systematically.\n\nWe have three training examples. Each input is 5x5, each output is 2x2. So the output grid is always 2x2. So maybe we are supposed to produce a 2x2 grid that is a transformation of the 5x5 grid. Perhaps we are selecting a 2x2 subgrid of the input. But which subgrid? Let's examine the outputs relative to the input positions. For each example, maybe the output grid corresponds to the 2x2 block of the input that contains the 2's? But the 2's are in the bottom right 2x2 block. But output grid in Example 1 is not all 2's; it's 1 0 / 1 1. So not the 2's block. Maybe it's the 2x2 block that is the same shape as the 1's block but at a certain location? Let's check if output matches any 2x2 subgrid of input. Let's list all 2x2 subgrids in Example 1:\n\nCoordinates for top-left of 2x2 subgrid can be (1-4,1-4). Let's list them:\n\nTL (1,1): subgrid rows1-2, cols1-2: \nRow1: 1 1\nRow2: 1 0\nSo 2x2: 1 1 / 1 0. Not equal to output (1 0 / 1 1). So not that.\n\nTL (1,2): rows1-2, cols2-3: \nRow1: 1 0\nRow2: 0 0\nSo 1 0 / 0 0. Not output.\n\nTL (1,3): rows1-2, cols3-4: \nRow1: 0 1\nRow2: 0 0\nSo 0 1 / 0 0.\n\nTL (1,4): rows1-2, cols4-5:\nRow1: 1 1\nRow2: 0 1\nSo 1 1 / 0 1. Not output.\n\nTL (2,1): rows2-3, cols1-2:\nRow2: 1 0\nRow3: 0 0\nSo 1 0 / 0 0.\n\nTL (2,2): rows2-3, cols2-3:\nRow2: 0 0\nRow3: 0 0\nSo 0 0 / 0 0.\n\nTL (2,3): rows2-3, cols3-4:\nRow2: 0 0\nRow3: 0 0\nSo 0 0 / 0 0.\n\nTL (2,4): rows2-3, cols4-5:\nRow2: 0 1\nRow3: 0 0\nSo 0 1 / 0 0.\n\nTL (3,1): rows3-4, cols1-2:\nRow3: 0 0\nRow4: 0 1\nSo 0 0 / 0 1.\n\nTL (3,2): rows3-4, cols2-3:\nRow3: 0 0\nRow4: 1 0\nSo 0 0 / 1 0.\n\nTL (3,3): rows3-4, cols3-4:\nRow3: 0 0\nRow4: 0 2\nSo 0 0 / 0 2.\n\nTL (3,4): rows3-4, cols4-5:\nRow3: 0 0\nRow4: 2 2\nSo 0 0 / 2 2.\n\nTL (4,1): rows4-5, cols1-2:\nRow4: 0 1\nRow5: 1 1\nSo 0 1 / 1 1. This is 0 1 / 1 1. Output is 1 0 / 1 1. So not that.\n\nTL (4,2): rows4-5, cols2-3:\nRow4: 1 0\nRow5: 1 0\nSo 1 0 / 1 0. Not output.\n\nTL (4,3): rows4-5, cols3-4:\nRow4: 0 2\nRow5: 0 2\nSo 0 2 / 0 2.\n\nTL (4,4): rows4-5, cols4-5:\nRow4: 2 2\nRow5: 2 2\nSo 2 2 / 2 2.\n\nSo none match the output. So output is not a subgrid of input.\n\nMaybe output is the pattern of 1's in the 2x2 block of the input that is located where the 2's block is? But the 2's block is at bottom right, but output is 1 0 / 1 1. That is not the 2's block. So maybe we shift the 2's block to some other location, like the 2's block is used as a template for output, but we replace the 2's with 1's or something? But output includes 1's and 0's only. So maybe we take the 2's block and transform it: maybe we map 2 to 1 and 0 to 0? That would produce 1 1 / 1 1, not output.\n\nMaybe we consider the shape of 1's that is \"adjacent\" to the 2's block, but we compress it into 2x2 by some rule. Let's examine Example 1: 1's near the 2's block? Which 1's are adjacent by 4-neighbor? None. By 8-neighbor? Let's see: cells around the 2's block: (3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,3),(5,4),(5,5). In Example 1, these cells: (3,3)=0,(3,4)=0,(3,5)=0,(4,3)=0,(4,4)=2,(4,5)=2,(5,3)=0,(5,4)=2,(5,5)=2. So only 2's. So no 1's. So maybe not.\n\nMaybe we consider the 1's that are \"mirrored\" or \"rotated\" relative to the 2's block. The 2's block is at bottom right. The 1's might be arranged in a pattern that is the reflection of the 2's block? Let's see: The 2's block is at rows 4-5, cols 4-5. The 1's might be at some other region that is symmetrical to the 2's block relative to the center of the grid. The grid center is at (3,3). Mirror of (4,4) across center would be (2,2). Mirror of (4,5) across center would be (2,4). Mirror of (5,4) across center would be (1,2). Mirror of (5,5) across center would be (1,1). Let's check if 1's exist at those positions: (2,2)=0, (2,4)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,1)=1. So two of them are 1's: (1,1) and (1,2). But output is 1 0 / 1 1. That doesn't match.\n\nMaybe we consider the 1's that are the complement of the 2's block? But the complement of 2's block is the rest of the grid. That includes many 1's. So maybe we compress that into 2x2 by some rule.\n\nMaybe we consider the 1's that are in the same positions relative to the 2's block as the 1's are relative to the 2's block? That is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the \"difference\" between the 1's distribution and the 2's distribution: we take the positions of 1's that are not overlapped by 2's and produce a 2x2 pattern. But we need to map them to a 2x2 grid. Maybe we overlay the 2's block onto the 1's block to find the intersection pattern? But 2's block is 2x2. The intersection of 1's and 2's block is none because 2's block has no 1's. So intersection is empty. So maybe we consider the \"shape\" of 1's that surround the 2's block? But we found none.\n\nMaybe we consider the \"outline\" of 1's around the 2's block: maybe we consider the 1's that are at the same relative positions as the 2's block relative to the 1's block? Eh.\n\nLet's examine Example 2 similarly. 2's block at bottom right. 1's positions: (1,1),(1,4),(1,5),(2,1),(2,2),(2,4),(4,1),(4,2),(5,2). Output: 0 1 / 1 1.\n\nCheck if output matches any 2x2 subgrid of input: we listed earlier all subgrids; none matched 0 1 / 1 1. Actually check TL (4,1): 0 1 / 1 1? Wait TL (4,1) gave 0 1 / 1 1? Let's recalc: TL (4,1) subgrid rows4-5, cols1-2: \nRow4: 1 1\nRow5: 0 1\nSo 1 1 / 0 1. That's 1 1 / 0 1, not 0 1 / 1 1.\n\nTL (4,2): 1 0 / 1 0. Not.\n\nTL (4,3): 0 2 / 0 2.\n\nSo not.\n\nMaybe output is the 2x2 grid of 1's that are at positions (some relative offset) from the 2's block. Let's examine relative positions of 1's to the 2's block. The 2's block occupies rows 4-5, cols 4-5. Let's compute relative coordinates of 1's relative to the 2's block. For each 1, compute delta row = row - 4, delta col = col - 4 (so relative to top-left of 2's block). That yields positions in range [-3,1] maybe. Let's list:\n\nExample 1 1's relative to top-left of 2's block (row4,col4):\n- (1,1): dr = 1-4 = -3, dc = 1-4 = -3\n- (1,2): dr = -3, dc = -2\n- (1,4): dr = -3, dc = 0\n- (1,5): dr = -3, dc = 1\n- (2,1): dr = -2, dc = -3\n- (2,5): dr = -2, dc = 1\n- (4,2): dr = 0, dc = -2\n- (5,1): dr = 1, dc = -3\n- (5,2): dr = 1, dc = -2\n\nSo relative positions: (-3,-3),(-3,-2),(-3,0),(-3,1),(-2,-3),(-2,1),(0,-2),(1,-3),(1,-2). So many positions.\n\nOutput is 2x2 grid. Could it be the pattern of 1's in the top-left 2x2 block of the input relative to the 2's block? But we need to find a 2x2 block of 1's relative to the 2's block? Let's consider the relative positions of 1's in the 2x2 block that is offset by something? For example, maybe we take the 2x2 block of 1's that is \"mirrored\" across the center of the grid relative to the 2's block. Let's find the mirror of each 1 across center (3,3). Mirror transformation: (r,c) -> (7-r,7-c) because grid is 5x5, center at (3,3). Mirror of (1,1) -> (5,5). Mirror of (1,2) -> (5,4). Mirror of (1,4) -> (5,2). Mirror of (1,5) -> (5,1). Mirror of (2,1) -> (4,5). Mirror of (2,5) -> (4,1). Mirror of (4,2) -> (2,4). Mirror of (5,1) -> (1,5). Mirror of (5,2) -> (1,4). So the mirrored positions: (5,5),(5,4),(5,2),(5,1),(4,5),(4,1),(2,4),(1,5),(1,4). Let's check if any of those positions have 1's? Let's see input: (5,5)=2, (5,4)=2, (5,2)=1, (5,1)=1, (4,5)=2, (4,1)=0, (2,4)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,4)=1. So among those, we have 1's at (5,2),(5,1),(1,5),(1,4). So 4 1's. But output is 1 0 / 1 1. Not match.\n\nMaybe the output grid is the \"difference\" between the 1's and 2's patterns: e.g., we take the 2x2 block of 2's and replace each 2 with the corresponding 1 if there's a 1 in the same relative position in the 1's pattern? But there are no 1's in the 2x2 block. So output would be all zeros? Not.\n\nMaybe we consider the 2x2 block of 1's that is the \"center\" of the 1's pattern? Let's find the bounding box of 1's in Example 1: min row=1, max row=5; min col=1, max col=5. So bounding box is entire grid. But maybe we find a 2x2 subgrid within the bounding box that has the same pattern as the 2's block? But 2's block is all 2's. But we don't have any 2's in 1's bounding box. So not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is the pattern of 1's that are at positions that are \"diagonally adjacent\" to the 2's block? Let's see: diagonal neighbors of 2's block: (3,3),(3,6),(4,3),(5,3),(6,3),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6),(4,6),(5,6). In grid: (3,3)=0, (4,3)=0, (5,3)=0. So no 1's. So no.\n\nMaybe we consider the 2x2 block of 1's that are at positions (row1,row2),(col1,col2) or something. For Example 1, top-left 2x2 block is 1 1 / 1 0. Output is 1 0 / 1 1. That is basically a rotated version of that block? Let's check: top-left 2x2 block is:\nRow1: 1 1\nRow2: 1 0\nIf we rotate 90 degrees clockwise, we get:\nRow1: 1 1\nRow2: 0 1\nBut output is 1 0 / 1 1. That's not that.\n\nIf we rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise: we get:\nRow1: 1 1\nRow2: 0 1? Wait let's compute: original block:\n[ [1,1], [1,0] ]\nRotate 90 CCW: \nFirst column becomes first row reversed? Let's compute: \nMatrix:\n[ [1,1],\n  [1,0] ]\n\nRotate 90 CCW: \nResult: \n[ [1,1], \n  [0,1] ]? Actually let's compute: The element at (i,j) moves to (n-1-j,i). For n=2. So positions:\n(0,0)->(1,0): value 1\n(0,1)->(0,0): value 1\n(1,0)->(1,1): value 1\n(1,1)->(0,1): value 0\n\nSo new matrix:\nRow0: (0,0)=1, (0,1)=0 => [1,0]\nRow1: (1,0)=1, (1,1)=1 => [1,1]\nSo result: 1 0 / 1 1. That matches output! So output is the top-left 2x2 block of the input rotated 90 degrees CCW.\n\nLet's verify with Example 2: Top-left 2x2 block of input Example 2: rows1-2, cols1-2: \nRow1: 1 0\nRow2: 1 1\nSo top-left 2x2 block: \n[ [1,0],\n  [1,1] ]\n\nRotate 90 CCW: \n(0,0)->(1,0): 1\n(0,1)->(0,0): 0\n(1,0)->(1,1): 1\n(1,1)->(0,1): 1\n\nSo new matrix:\nRow0: [0,1]\nRow1: [1,1]\nThus 0 1 / 1 1. That matches output of Example 2. Great.\n\nExample 3: Top-left 2x2 block: rows1-2, cols1-2:\nRow1: 1 1\nRow2: 0 0\nSo block: [ [1,1], [0,0] ]\n\nRotate 90 CCW: \n(0,0)->(1,0): 1\n(0,1)->(0,0): 1\n(1,0)->(1,1): 0\n(1,1)->(0,1): 0\n\nSo new matrix:\nRow0: [1,0]\nRow1: [1,0]\nThat matches output: 1 0 / 1 0. Yes.\n\nThus the transformation rule: The output is the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input, rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nNow test input: We need to take the top-left 2x2 block of the test input, rotate it 90 degrees CCW, produce 2x2 output.\n\nTest Input grid:\nRow1: 1 1 0 0 1\nRow2: 0 1 0 1 1\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 1 0 0 2 2\nRow5: 1 1 0 2 2\n\nTop-left 2x2 block: rows1-2, cols1-2:\nRow1: 1 1\nRow2: 0 1\n\nSo block: [ [1,1], [0,1] ]\n\nRotate 90 CCW: We can compute as before: For 2x2 matrix M:\nM = [ [a,b], [c,d] ].\n\nRotate 90 CCW yields: [ [b,d], [a,c] ]? Wait we need to derive formula. Let's derive transformation for 2x2.\n\nWe have M:\n(0,0)=a\n(0,1)=b\n(1,0)=c\n(1,1)=d\n\nWe want to rotate 90 degrees CCW: mapping (i,j) -> (n-1-j,i) for n=2.\n\nCompute new positions:\n- (0,0) -> (1,0) => a goes to new[1][0]\n- (0,1) -> (0,0) => b goes to new[0][0]\n- (1,0) -> (1,1) => c goes to new[1][1]\n- (1,1) -> (0,1) => d goes to new[0][1]\n\nThus new matrix new[0][0] = b\nnew[0][1] = d\nnew[1][0] = a\nnew[1][1] = c\n\nSo rotated matrix: [ [b,d], [a,c] ].\n\nLet's apply to block [ [1,1], [0,1] ]: a=1,b=1,c=0,d=1.\n\nThen rotated: [ [b,d], [a,c] ] = [ [1,1], [1,0] ].\n\nThus output: Row1: 1 1\nRow2: 1 0\n\nBut let's double-check with the earlier examples: For Example 1, block [ [1,1], [1,0] ], a=1,b=1,c=1,d=0. Rotated: [ [b,d], [a,c] ] = [ [1,0], [1,1] ]. That matches output 1 0 / 1 1. Good.\n\nExample 2: block [ [1,0], [1,1] ], a=1,b=0,c=1,d=1. Rotated: [ [b,d], [a,c] ] = [ [0,1], [1,1] ]. That matches output 0 1 / 1 1.\n\nExample 3: block [ [1,1], [0,0] ], a=1,b=1,c=0,d=0. Rotated: [ [b,d], [a,c] ] = [ [1,0], [1,0] ]. That matches output 1 0 / 1 0.\n\nSo rule is consistent: output is the top-left 2x2 block rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nThus for test input, block is [ [1,1], [0,1] ]. Rotated CCW: [ [1,1], [1,0] ].\n\nThus output grid:\n\n1 1\n1 0\n\nCheck that the output matches pattern of 2x2 grid. Yes.\n\nThus answer: \n1 1\n1 0\n\nLet's double-check test input top-left 2x2 block: row1 col1=1, row1 col2=1; row2 col1=0, row2 col2=1. So block: 1 1 / 0 1. Rotated CCW yields 1 1 / 1 0. Yes.\n\nThus output. Let's produce final answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>1 1\n1 0<|return|>",
    "8": "<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to infer the transformation rule from the training examples. Let's analyze each example.\n\nWe have Input grids of various sizes (mostly 13x13 or 13x? Wait: Example 1 input is 13x13? Let's check: Provided rows: 13 rows. Each row length: first row: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 13 columns. So 13x13. Output grid: 6x6. Example 2 input: 13x13, output: 7x7. Example 3 input: 13x13, output: 4x7? Wait: Let's check. Example 3 output: \n\"8 8 8 8 8 8 8\" -> 7 columns. Next rows: 7 columns each. 4 rows. So 4x7. Example 4 input: 13x13, output: 4x4. So outputs vary in size.\n\nObservations: In each example, the input has a shape of a particular color (like 8 in Example 1, 3 in Example 2, 8 in Example 3, 1 in Example 4). The output seems to be a compressed version of the shape? Let's analyze.\n\nExample 1: Input has a block of 8s forming a border (a ring) and interior region of 4s, 3s, 2s? Wait: Let's examine the input. Input grid: 13x13. The 8s form a ring from row 6 to 11? Let's list coordinates: Starting at row 6 (0-index? But we can just analyze). The 8s appear in rows 6-11, columns 4-9? Actually, row 6: \"0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\" -> 8s at columns 4-9 inclusive. Row 7: \"0 0 0 0 8 8 4 8 8 8 0 0 0\" -> 8s at 4,5,7,8,9; 4 at 6. Row 8: \"0 0 0 0 8 4 4 4 8 8 0 0 0\" -> 8 at 4,8,9; 4 at 5,6,7. Row 9: \"0 0 0 0 8 3 4 3 8 8 0 0 0\" -> 8 at 4,8,9; 3 at 5,7; 4 at 6. Row 10: \"0 0 0 0 8 3 3 3 8 8 0 0 0\" -> 8 at 4,8,9; 3 at 5,6,7. Row 11: \"0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\" -> 8 at 4-9 inclusive. So there's a ring of 8s bounding an interior area of 4s, 3s, 2s? Wait, 2s appear at row 1 column 1? Actually, row 1: \"0 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 2 at (1,1). 3 at (1,2). Row 3: \"0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 1 at (3,1), 4 at (3,2). So there's a small cluster of 1,2,3,4 at top-left area. There's also a cluster of 1,2,3,4 at top-left? Wait: 1 at (3,1), 4 at (3,2). 1 at (1,1)? Actually 2 at (1,1), 3 at (1,2). So there are two clusters: one small cluster at top-left, and a big ring of 8s with interior 4s,3s,2s.\n\nThe output is a 6x6 grid: \nRow0: 8 8 8 8 8 8\nRow1: 8 8 1 8 8 8\nRow2: 8 1 1 1 8 8\nRow3: 8 2 1 2 8 8\nRow4: 8 2 2 2 8 8\nRow5: 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nIt looks like the output is a transformation of the ring: the outer border of 8s remains 8, interior replaced with pattern derived from the cluster at top-left? Actually, the output seems to be a 6x6 representation of the interior of the ring? Let's examine the interior of the ring in input: The ring of 8s encloses a 6x6 area? The ring coordinates: columns 4-9 inclusive (6 columns), rows 6-11 inclusive (6 rows). So the interior area is rows 7-10 inclusive (4 rows) and columns 5-8 inclusive (4 columns). Wait, but ring width 1. So interior area is 4x4. But output is 6x6. So maybe output is the ring plus interior? Actually output 6x6 includes outer border of 8s (6x6). That matches ring size 6x6. So output is the ring area, with interior filled with something derived from the cluster at top-left. Let's analyze interior of output: 4x4 area inside outer border. Output interior cells: \nRow1: 1 8 8 8? Wait, row1: 8 8 1 8 8 8. So interior at (1,2) is 1? Actually indices: row1 col0=8, col1=8, col2=1, col3=8, col4=8, col5=8. So interior cells (rows 1-4, cols 1-4?) Let's map: Outer border is row0 and row5, col0 and col5. So interior 4x4 is rows 1-4, cols 1-4. Let's list them:\n\nRow1: col1=8, col2=1, col3=8, col4=8\nRow2: col1=1, col2=1, col3=1, col4=8\nRow3: col1=2, col2=1, col3=2, col4=8\nRow4: col1=2, col2=2, col3=2, col4=8\n\nSo interior 4x4: \n[ [8,1,8,8],\n  [1,1,1,8],\n  [2,1,2,8],\n  [2,2,2,8] ]\n\nNow, compare with the small cluster at top-left: In input, cluster positions: \n(1,1)=2, (1,2)=3, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=4. So cluster 2x2: \nRow1: 2 3\nRow3: 1 4\nBut there are also other numbers? Actually, 3 at (1,2), 4 at (3,2). So cluster is 2x2 but with values 2,3,1,4. But output interior has values 1,2,3? Wait, output interior values are 8,1,8,8,1,1,1,8,2,1,2,8,2,2,2,8. So interior has 1,2,8. There is no 3 or 4. So maybe the cluster is being replaced by some mapping? Let's analyze the cluster mapping: The cluster's values are 2,3,1,4. Output interior uses 1 and 2 and 8. So 1 and 2 appear. 3 and 4 are not used. But 8 is used as background maybe.\n\nMaybe the output interior is a transformed version of the cluster: maybe it's a rotated or mirrored pattern? Let's see: The cluster 2x2: \n2 3\n1 4\n\nThe output interior 4x4 is more complex. But maybe it's the cluster repeated or something. But let's examine other examples to find pattern.\n\nExample 2: Input: 13x13. Output: 7x7. Let's analyze input.\n\nInput 2: \nRow0: all zeros.\nRow1: all zeros.\nRow2: \"0 0 0 0 0 6 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 6 at col5, 8 at col6.\nRow3: zeros.\nRow4: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0\" -> 2 at col9, 1 at col10.\nRow5: zeros.\nRow6: \"0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 4 5 0 0\" -> 3 at col1-7, 4 at col9, 5 at col10.\nRow7: \"0 3 5 5 5 5 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 3 at col1,6,7; 5 at col2-5.\nRow8: \"0 3 3 1 1 5 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 3 at col1,6,7; 1 at col3-4; 5 at col5.\nRow9: \"0 3 8 1 1 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 3 at col1,5,6,7; 8 at col2; 1 at col3-4.\nRow10: \"0 3 8 8 8 8 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 3 at col1,6,7; 8 at col2-5.\nRow11: \"0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 3 at col1-7.\nRow12: same as row11.\n\nSo we have a large shape of 3's forming a border? Let's examine the shape of 3's: They form a rectangular border from row6 to row12, columns1-7. Actually, row6 has 3 at col1-7. Row7 has 3 at col1,6,7. Row8 has 3 at col1,6,7. Row9 has 3 at col1,5,6,7. Row10 has 3 at col1,6,7. Row11 has 3 at col1-7. Row12 has 3 at col1-7. So it's a rectangular ring of 3s with interior region of 4's, 5's, 1's, 6's? Wait, inside the ring there are other colors: 4 at (6,9) but that's outside the ring? Actually ring of 3's is from row6-12, col1-7. So interior region is rows7-11, cols2-6. Inside that region we have 4 at (6,9) is outside ring. But inside ring we have 5 at (6,10), 5 at (7,2-5), 5 at (8,5), 1 at (8,3-4), 1 at (9,3-4), 8 at (9,2), 8 at (10,2-5). So interior includes 1,5,8. Also 6 at (2,5) and 8 at (2,6) are outside ring. And 2 at (4,9) and 1 at (4,10) are outside ring. So maybe the output is the ring area, with interior replaced by something derived from the cluster of 6 and 8? Wait, 6 and 8 cluster at (2,5),(2,6) is small. There's also 2 at (4,9),(4,10). So there are multiple clusters.\n\nOutput 2: 7x7 grid:\nRow0: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\nRow1: 3 4 4 4 4 3 3\nRow2: 3 3 2 2 4 3 3\nRow3: 3 6 2 2 3 3 3\nRow4: 3 6 6 6 6 3 3\nRow5: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\nRow6: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nSo output 7x7. Outer border is 3s (like ring). The interior 5x5 is filled with pattern of 4,2,6,3? Let's examine interior 5x5 (rows1-5, cols1-5):\nRow1: 4 4 4 4 3? Wait row1: 3 4 4 4 4 3 3. So interior row1: col1=4, col2=4, col3=4, col4=4, col5=3? Actually col5 is 3? Wait, interior columns are 1-5 inclusive. So row1 interior: 4,4,4,4,3. Row2 interior: 3,2,2,4,3? Wait row2: 3 3 2 2 4 3 3. So interior row2: 3,2,2,4,3. Row3: 3 6 2 2 3 3 3 -> interior: 6,2,2,3,3? Wait row3 interior: col1=6, col2=2, col3=2, col4=3, col5=3. Row4: 3 6 6 6 6 3 3 -> interior: 6,6,6,6,3. Row5: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 -> interior: 3,3,3,3,3.\n\nSo interior 5x5 is: \nRow1: 4 4 4 4 3\nRow2: 3 2 2 4 3\nRow3: 6 2 2 3 3\nRow4: 6 6 6 6 3\nRow5: 3 3 3 3 3\n\nNow, compare with interior of ring in input: interior rows7-11, cols2-6. Let's map that interior from input:\n\nRow7 (index 7): row7: \"0 3 5 5 5 5 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" -> col2=5, col3=5, col4=5, col5=5, col6=3? Wait, interior columns 2-6 inclusive: col2=5, col3=5, col4=5, col5=5, col6=3. So interior row7: 5 5 5 5 3.\n\nRow8: \"0 3 3 1 1 5 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" -> col2=3, col3=1, col4=1, col5=5, col6=3. So interior row8: 3 1 1 5 3.\n\nRow9: \"0 3 8 1 1 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" -> col2=8, col3=1, col4=1, col5=3, col6=3. So interior row9: 8 1 1 3 3.\n\nRow10: \"0 3 8 8 8 8 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" -> col2=8, col3=8, col4=8, col5=8, col6=3. So interior row10: 8 8 8 8 3.\n\nRow11: \"0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" -> interior row11: col2=3, col3=3, col4=3, col5=3, col6=3. So interior row11: 3 3 3 3 3.\n\nSo interior of ring in input: \nRow7: 5 5 5 5 3\nRow8: 3 1 1 5 3\nRow9: 8 1 1 3 3\nRow10: 8 8 8 8 3\nRow11: 3 3 3 3 3\n\nNow compare with output interior: \nRow1: 4 4 4 4 3\nRow2: 3 2 2 4 3\nRow3: 6 2 2 3 3\nRow4: 6 6 6 6 3\nRow5: 3 3 3 3 3\n\nIt seems like the output interior is the input interior with a mapping of colors: 5->4, 1->2, 8->6, 3 remains 3? Let's check mapping: \nInput interior: 5,5,5,5,3 -> output interior: 4,4,4,4,3. So 5->4, 3 stays 3. \nNext row: input: 3,1,1,5,3 -> output: 3,2,2,4,3. So 1->2, 5->4, 3 stays 3. \nNext row: input: 8,1,1,3,3 -> output: 6,2,2,3,3. So 8->6, 1->2, 3 stays 3. \nNext row: input: 8,8,8,8,3 -> output: 6,6,6,6,3. So 8->6, 3 stays 3. \nLast row: input: 3,3,3,3,3 -> output: 3,3,3,3,3. So 3 stays 3.\n\nSo mapping: 5->4, 1->2, 8->6, 3->3. The mapping seems consistent. Also 2 appears in output but not in input interior; 2 appears as mapping of 1. 4 appears as mapping of 5. 6 appears as mapping of 8. So mapping is: \n- 1 (input) -> 2 (output)\n- 5 (input) -> 4 (output)\n- 8 (input) -> 6 (output)\n- 3 (input) -> 3 (output)\n\nAlso maybe 2 and 4 and 6 are new colors in output. They are not present in input interior but appear as mapping.\n\nNow, where do these mapping values come from? Possibly from the small clusters outside the ring. Let's examine outside cluster: There is a cluster at (2,5)=6 and (2,6)=8. That cluster has 6 and 8. There is also a cluster at (4,9)=2, (4,10)=1. Wait, 1 at (4,10) is outside ring? Actually ring is col1-7, so col9,10 are outside ring. So cluster of 2 and 1 outside ring. And also cluster of 3? Actually, 3 appears outside ring at (6,9)=4? Wait, 4 at (6,9) is outside ring. But 4 is not inside ring. But 4 appears in output interior as mapping of 5. So 4 maybe derived from 4 at (6,9). But 4 is mapping of 5, not 4? Wait, mapping 5->4. So 4 appears as mapping of 5. But 4 appears in input outside ring at (6,9). So maybe mapping is derived from mapping of colors to new colors that correspond to the colors of other clusters outside ring. Let's examine all outside cluster colors: \n- 6 at (2,5)\n- 8 at (2,6)\n- 4 at (6,9)\n- 2 at (4,9)\n- 1 at (4,10)\n- 5 at (6,10)\n- 4 at (6,9) we already counted.\n- 5 at (6,10) is outside ring.\n\nBut 5 appears outside ring at (6,10). But 5 is inside ring interior. Wait, 5 at (6,10) is outside ring because ring columns 1-7. So 5 at col10 is outside ring. So mapping 5->4 might come from mapping 5 outside ring to 4 inside ring? But 4 at (6,9) is also outside ring. So maybe mapping is from colors outside ring to new colors inside ring. But mapping of 5->4: 5 outside ring maps to 4 inside ring. But 4 outside ring maps to something? 4 outside ring appears at (6,9). But mapping of 4 outside ring to something inside ring? 4 outside ring might map to 6? Wait, 4 outside ring appears at (6,9). But 4 is also inside ring? Actually, 4 appears inside ring at row7? Wait, row7 inside ring has 5 at col2-5. No 4 inside ring. So 4 outside ring might map to 6? But we see 8 inside ring maps to 6. So mapping of 8->6. 8 outside ring is at (2,6). So 8 outside ring maps to 6 inside ring. So mapping of 8->6. So mapping of 5->4: 5 outside ring at (6,10) maps to 4 inside ring. So mapping of 1->2: 1 outside ring at (4,10) maps to 2 inside ring. So mapping of 2->? Actually, 2 outside ring at (4,9) might map to something inside ring? But we didn't see mapping of 2 inside ring. But maybe 2 outside ring maps to 3? Wait, 3 inside ring is the background color of ring. But 3 inside ring is the ring color. But mapping of 2 outside ring might not be used because 2 doesn't appear inside ring interior. So mapping may be from colors outside ring to new colors inside ring interior.\n\nThus, the transformation rule might be: Identify a rectangular ring of a certain color (outer ring). Then, replace the interior of the ring with a mapping of colors based on the mapping of colors outside the ring. That is, map each interior color to a new color based on a mapping derived from the colors outside the ring. But we need to determine how mapping is derived: For each color in interior, find a corresponding color outside ring that matches some pattern? But the mapping seems to be: interior color 5 -> output 4, interior color 1 -> output 2, interior color 8 -> output 6. These mapping correspond to colors outside ring: 5->4, 1->2, 8->6. So mapping of interior color to new color is maybe: For each interior color X, find a color Y outside ring such that Y's value is X+? Wait, 5 outside ring maps to 4 inside ring. 1 outside ring maps to 2 inside ring. 8 outside ring maps to 6 inside ring. So mapping is not consistent: 5->4 (difference -1), 1->2 (+1), 8->6 (-2). So not simple numeric difference.\n\nMaybe mapping is from color X inside ring to the color that appears in the same relative position outside ring? But maybe the mapping is derived from a pattern: For each interior color X, find the color Y that appears at the same relative offset from the ring's outer border? But that seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mapping is derived from the colors of the cluster at top-left in Example 1, cluster at top-right in Example 2, etc. Let's examine Example 1 again: The mapping from interior colors to output interior: interior color 4 -> output 1? Wait, interior color 4 appears at (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)? Actually interior of ring in Example 1: \nInput interior (rows7-10, cols5-8):\nRow7: 4 4 4\nRow8: 4 4 4\nRow9: 4 3 4\nRow10: 3 3 3\nWait, let's recalc: Input interior rows7-10, cols5-8 inclusive: \nRow7: col5=4, col6=4, col7=4, col8=8? Wait, interior columns are 5-8 inclusive? Outer ring columns 4-9 inclusive. So interior columns 5-8 inclusive. So row7: col5=4, col6=4, col7=4, col8=8? Wait, row7: \"0 0 0 0 8 8 4 8 8 8 0 0 0\" -> col5=8, col6=4, col7=8, col8=8? Wait, let's index: row7 columns: 0-12. col4=8, col5=8, col6=4, col7=8, col8=8, col9=8. So interior columns 5-8: col5=8, col6=4, col7=8, col8=8. So row7 interior: 8,4,8,8.\n\nRow8: row8: \"0 0 0 0 8 4 4 4 8 8 0 0 0\" -> col4=8, col5=4, col6=4, col7=4, col8=8, col9=8. So interior: col5=4, col6=4, col7=4, col8=8 -> 4,4,4,8.\n\nRow9: row9: \"0 0 0 0 8 3 4 3 8 8 0 0 0\" -> col4=8, col5=3, col6=4, col7=3, col8=8, col9=8. So interior: 3,4,3,8.\n\nRow10: row10: \"0 0 0 0 8 3 3 3 8 8 0 0 0\" -> interior: 3,3,3,8.\n\nSo interior 4x4 (rows7-10, cols5-8):\nRow7: 8 4 8 8\nRow8: 4 4 4 8\nRow9: 3 4 3 8\nRow10: 3 3 3 8\n\nNow, output interior 4x4 we found earlier:\n[ [8,1,8,8],\n  [1,1,1,8],\n  [2,1,2,8],\n  [2,2,2,8] ]\n\nSo mapping from input interior to output interior: \n- Input 8 -> output 8? Actually, input 8 at (7,5) maps to output 8 at (1,1)? Wait, we need to align coordinates: Input interior coordinates (relative to interior) row0-col0 corresponds to output interior row0-col0? Let's align: Input interior row7-col5 is top-left of interior. Output interior row1-col1? Wait, output interior is 4x4 starting at row1-col1. So mapping: Input interior row0-col0 -> output interior row0-col0? Actually, output interior row0-col0 is 8? Let's check output interior row0-col0: from output interior we listed earlier: \nRow1: 8,1,8,8 -> interior row0: 8,1,8,8\nRow2: 1,1,1,8 -> interior row1: 1,1,1,8\nRow3: 2,1,2,8 -> interior row2: 2,1,2,8\nRow4: 2,2,2,8 -> interior row3: 2,2,2,8\n\nSo output interior row0-col0 = 8. Input interior row0-col0 = 8. So mapping: 8->8. Good. Input interior row0-col1 = 4 -> output interior row0-col1 = 1. So mapping: 4->1. Input interior row0-col2 = 8 -> output interior row0-col2 = 8. So mapping: 8->8. Input interior row0-col3 = 8 -> output interior row0-col3 = 8. So mapping: 8->8.\n\nNext row: Input interior row1-col0 = 4 -> output interior row1-col0 = 1. So mapping: 4->1. Input interior row1-col1 = 4 -> output interior row1-col1 = 1. So mapping: 4->1. Input interior row1-col2 = 4 -> output interior row1-col2 = 1. So mapping: 4->1. Input interior row1-col3 = 8 -> output interior row1-col3 = 8. So mapping: 8->8.\n\nRow2: Input interior row2-col0 = 3 -> output interior row2-col0 = 2. So mapping: 3->2. Input interior row2-col1 = 4 -> output interior row2-col1 = 1. So mapping: 4->1. Input interior row2-col2 = 3 -> output interior row2-col2 = 2. So mapping: 3->2. Input interior row2-col3 = 8 -> output interior row2-col3 = 8.\n\nRow3: Input interior row3-col0 = 3 -> output interior row3-col0 = 2. So mapping: 3->2. Input interior row3-col1 = 3 -> output interior row3-col1 = 2. So mapping: 3->2. Input interior row3-col2 = 3 -> output interior row3-col2 = 2. So mapping: 3->2. Input interior row3-col3 = 8 -> output interior row3-col3 = 8.\n\nThus mapping: 8->8, 4->1, 3->2. So mapping from interior colors to output interior colors: 8 stays 8, 4->1, 3->2. This mapping corresponds to mapping of colors from outside cluster? Let's examine outside cluster: At top-left cluster: 1 at (3,1), 2 at (1,1), 3 at (1,2), 4 at (3,2). So mapping might be: 4->1 (4 from cluster maps to 1 inside interior), 3->2 (3 from cluster maps to 2 inside interior), 2->? 2 from cluster might map to something else but we didn't see 2 inside interior. Wait, 2 from cluster maps to maybe 2? But we didn't see 2 inside interior. But maybe mapping of 2->? But we didn't see 2 inside interior. Actually, interior mapping 3->2 uses 3 from cluster mapping to 2 inside interior. But mapping of 4->1 uses 4 from cluster mapping to 1 inside interior. So mapping seems to be: For each color in cluster at top-left, map to a new color inside interior: 4->1, 3->2, 2->? Wait, 2 from cluster appears at (1,1) but we didn't see mapping for 2 inside interior. But maybe 2 maps to 3? But 2 didn't appear inside interior. But maybe mapping of 2->? But we didn't need mapping for 2 because 2 not present in interior. But we need mapping for 3 and 4 because they appear in interior. So mapping is derived from cluster at top-left: For each color X in cluster, map to new color Y that appears in interior? Wait, 3 in cluster maps to 2 in interior. 4 in cluster maps to 1 in interior. So mapping from cluster colors to interior colors: 3->2, 4->1. 2 from cluster might map to 3? But 2 didn't appear in interior. But maybe mapping of 2->? Actually, 2 might map to 3 inside interior but 3 not present. But maybe 2 maps to 3 which is not used. But we can't confirm.\n\nAlternatively, mapping might be from interior colors to cluster colors: 4->1, 3->2. That would mean interior color 4 maps to cluster color 1. But cluster color 1 is at (3,1). So mapping interior 4->1. Similarly, interior 3->2. So mapping interior color 3 to cluster color 2. That seems plausible: interior color 4 -> cluster color 1, interior color 3 -> cluster color 2. So mapping from interior colors to cluster colors. But cluster colors are 1,2,3,4. But mapping uses only 1 and 2. But cluster also has 4 and 3. But interior colors 4 and 3 map to cluster colors 1 and 2. So mapping might be: interior color 4 -> cluster color 1; interior color 3 -> cluster color 2. That mapping is consistent: 4->1, 3->2. And 8->8? 8 is ring color, not cluster. But 8 stays 8.\n\nNow, we need to see if this mapping holds in Example 2: In Example 2, interior colors were 5,1,8,3. They map to output interior colors 4,2,6,3. Let's see if mapping interior->cluster works: cluster colors outside ring: 6,8,4,2,1,5? Actually, cluster outside ring includes colors 6,8,4,2,1,5. But mapping interior 5->4: cluster color 4 appears outside ring. So interior 5 maps to cluster color 4. Yes. Interior 1->2: cluster color 2 appears outside ring. So mapping interior 1->2. Interior 8->6: cluster color 6 appears outside ring. So mapping interior 8->6. Interior 3 stays 3: cluster color 3 appears inside ring? Wait, cluster color 3 appears outside ring at (6,9)? Actually, 3 appears at (6,9) which is outside ring? Wait, ring columns 1-7, so col9 is outside ring. So 3 appears outside ring. So mapping interior 3->3: cluster color 3 appears outside ring. So mapping interior 3->3. So mapping interior->cluster: 5->4, 1->2, 8->6, 3->3. That matches mapping we found. So mapping interior color X -> cluster color Y such that Y appears in the cluster outside ring. That cluster includes the colors 6,8,4,2,1,5. So mapping interior->cluster color Y: 5->4, 1->2, 8->6, 3->3. Good.\n\nNow, Example 3: Let's analyze. Input 3: 13x13. Output 4x7. Input has ring of 8's? Let's examine. Input 3: \nRow0: all zeros.\nRow1: \"0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\" -> 8 at columns 2-8 inclusive. So ring of 8's from row1 to row4? \nRow2: \"0 0 8 8 2 4 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\" -> 8 at col2,3,6,7,8; 2 at col4, 4 at col5.\nRow3: \"0 0 8 2 2 4 4 4 8 0 0 0 0\" -> 8 at col2,8; 2 at col3,4; 4 at col5,6,7.\nRow4: \"0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\" -> 8 at col2-8 inclusive.\nSo ring of 8's from rows1-4, cols2-8 inclusive. So ring size 4x7? Actually, outer ring width 1: ring is 4 rows tall (rows1-4) and 7 columns wide (cols2-8). So ring area is 4x7. The interior of ring is rows2-3, cols3-7 inclusive (2 rows, 5 columns). So interior is 2x5. Input interior: \nRow2: col3=8? Wait, row2: \"0 0 8 8 2 4 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\" -> col2=8, col3=8, col4=2, col5=4, col6=8, col7=8, col8=8. So interior columns 3-7: col3=8, col4=2, col5=4, col6=8, col7=8. So interior row2: 8,2,4,8,8.\nRow3: \"0 0 8 2 2 4 4 4 8 0 0 0 0\" -> col2=8, col3=2, col4=2, col5=4, col6=4, col7=4, col8=8. So interior columns 3-7: 2,2,4,4,4. So interior row3: 2,2,4,4,4.\n\nSo interior 2x5: \nRow0: 8,2,4,8,8\nRow1: 2,2,4,4,4\n\nNow, output 4x7: \nRow0: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nRow1: 8 8 3 1 8 8 8\nRow2: 8 3 3 1 1 1 8\nRow3: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nSo output ring is 4x7 of 8's. The interior 2x5 is: \nRow1 interior: col1=8? Wait, interior columns 1-5 inclusive? Actually, output ring columns 0-6 inclusive. So interior columns 1-5 inclusive. Output interior rows1-2, cols1-5: \nRow1: 8,3,1,8,8? Wait, row1: \"8 8 3 1 8 8 8\" -> col0=8, col1=8, col2=3, col3=1, col4=8, col5=8, col6=8. So interior row1: 8,3,1,8,8? Wait, interior columns 1-5: col1=8, col2=3, col3=1, col4=8, col5=8. So interior row1: 8,3,1,8,8.\nRow2: \"8 3 3 1 1 1 8\" -> col0=8, col1=3, col2=3, col3=1, col4=1, col5=1, col6=8. So interior row2: 3,3,1,1,1.\n\nSo interior 2x5: \nRow0: 8,3,1,8,8\nRow1: 3,3,1,1,1\n\nNow compare input interior to output interior: \nInput interior row0: 8,2,4,8,8\nInput interior row1: 2,2,4,4,4\n\nOutput interior row0: 8,3,1,8,8\nOutput interior row1: 3,3,1,1,1\n\nMapping: 8->8, 2->3? Wait, input interior row0 col1 = 2 maps to output interior row0 col1 = 3. So 2->3. Input interior row0 col2 = 4 maps to output interior row0 col2 = 1. So 4->1. Input interior row1 col0 = 2 maps to output interior row1 col0 = 3. So 2->3. Input interior row1 col1 = 2 maps to output interior row1 col1 = 3. So 2->3. Input interior row1 col2 = 4 maps to output interior row1 col2 = 1. So 4->1. Input interior row1 col3 = 4 maps to output interior row1 col3 = 1. So 4->1. Input interior row1 col4 = 4 maps to output interior row1 col4 = 1. So 4->1.\n\nSo mapping interior colors to output: 8->8, 2->3, 4->1. This mapping corresponds to mapping interior color to cluster color outside ring. Let's examine cluster outside ring: Outside ring, we have colors: 6 at (2,5)? Wait, no, input 3 has 6? Actually, input 3 has 6? Wait, let's check: In input 3, we have 6? No, input 3 has only 8,2,4, and maybe other colors? Let's examine input 3: \nRow0: zeros\nRow1: 8's\nRow2: 8 8 2 4 8 8 8\nRow3: 8 2 2 4 4 4 8\nRow4: 8's\nRow5: zeros\nRow6: zeros\nRow7: \"0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 1 at col1, 4 at col2. So cluster outside ring: 1 at (7,1), 4 at (7,2). \nRow8: zeros\nRow9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0\" -> 3 at col7, 2 at col8. So cluster outside ring: 3 at (9,7), 2 at (9,8). \nRow10: zeros\nRow11: zeros\nRow12: zeros\n\nSo outside ring cluster has colors 1,4,3,2. So mapping interior color 4 -> 1, interior color 2 -> 3. That matches mapping interior->cluster: 4->1, 2->3. 8 stays 8. So mapping interior color X to cluster color Y such that Y is present outside ring. Good.\n\nNow Example 4: Input 4: 13x13. Output 4x4. Input has ring of 1? Let's analyze. Input 4: \nRow0: zeros\nRow1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 2 at col6, 4 at col7. So small cluster of 2,4. \nRow2: zeros\nRow3: zeros\nRow4: \"0 1 4 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 1 at col1, 4 at col2,4 at col3, 1 at col4. So cluster of 1,4. \nRow5: \"0 8 8 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 8 at col1, 8 at col2, 4 at col3, 1 at col4. \nRow6: \"0 8 8 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 8 at col1, 8 at col2, 1 at col3, 1 at col4. \nRow7: \"0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 1 at col1, 1 at col2, 1 at col3, 1 at col4. \nRow8: zeros\nRow9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 0 0 0 0\" -> 3 at col7, 8 at col8. \nRow10: zeros\nRow11: zeros\nRow12: zeros\n\nSo we have a ring of 1's? Let's examine: There is a cluster of 1's at rows4-7, cols1-4. That cluster forms a rectangle 4x4. But is it a ring? Let's check: The cluster at rows4-7, cols1-4: \nRow4: 1,4,4,1\nRow5: 8,8,4,1\nRow6: 8,8,1,1\nRow7: 1,1,1,1\n\nThis is not a ring: It has interior 4's at row4 col2-3, 8's at row5 col1-2, etc. But maybe the ring is the outer border of 1's? Actually, outer border of 1's: row4 col1=1, col4=1; row5 col1=8, col4=1; row6 col1=8, col4=1; row7 col1=1, col4=1. So the outer border of 1's is not a continuous ring of 1's: there are 8's at row5 col1, row6 col1. So not ring. But maybe the ring is of 3? There's a cluster of 3 at row9 col7? Actually, 3 at (9,7) is a single pixel. So not ring.\n\nWait, maybe the ring is of 1's but with interior replaced by something? Let's analyze the output: 4x4 grid: \nRow0: 1 2 2 1\nRow1: 3 3 2 1\nRow2: 3 3 1 1\nRow3: 1 1 1 1\n\nSo output is 4x4. Outer border of output: row0: 1,2,2,1; row3: 1,1,1,1; col0: 1,3,3,1; col3: 1,1,1,1. So outer border is not uniform. But maybe output is the region of 1's? Let's examine input cluster of 1's: It's 4x4 region of 1's at rows4-7, cols1-4. That region's outer border is 1's except some interior 4's and 8's. But output seems to be a transformation of that region.\n\nLet's examine the input cluster of 1's: \nRows 4-7, Cols1-4:\nRow4: 1 4 4 1\nRow5: 8 8 4 1\nRow6: 8 8 1 1\nRow7: 1 1 1 1\n\nSo the cluster is a 4x4 region. The output is also 4x4. So maybe the output is a transformation of that region. Let's see mapping: \nInput cluster:\nRow0: 1 4 4 1\nRow1: 8 8 4 1\nRow2: 8 8 1 1\nRow3: 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput cluster:\nRow0: 1 2 2 1\nRow1: 3 3 2 1\nRow2: 3 3 1 1\nRow3: 1 1 1 1\n\nMapping: Input 1 -> output 1? Yes, 1 stays 1. Input 4 -> output 2? Wait, input 4 at row0 col1 maps to output 2 at row0 col1. Input 4 at row0 col2 maps to output 2 at row0 col2. Input 4 at row1 col2 maps to output 2 at row1 col2. Input 4 at row1 col? Actually, row1 col2 is 4, maps to output 2. Input 4 at row? Wait, row1 col? Let's systematically map each cell:\n\nInput cluster coordinates (relative to cluster):\n- (0,0): 1 -> output (0,0): 1\n- (0,1): 4 -> output (0,1): 2\n- (0,2): 4 -> output (0,2): 2\n- (0,3): 1 -> output (0,3): 1\n\n- (1,0): 8 -> output (1,0): 3\n- (1,1): 8 -> output (1,1): 3\n- (1,2): 4 -> output (1,2): 2\n- (1,3): 1 -> output (1,3): 1\n\n- (2,0): 8 -> output (2,0): 3\n- (2,1): 8 -> output (2,1): 3\n- (2,2): 1 -> output (2,2): 1\n- (2,3): 1 -> output (2,3): 1\n\n- (3,0): 1 -> output (3,0): 1\n- (3,1): 1 -> output (3,1): 1\n- (3,2): 1 -> output (3,2): 1\n- (3,3): 1 -> output (3,3): 1\n\nMapping: 1->1, 4->2, 8->3. So mapping interior colors to new colors: 1 stays 1, 4->2, 8->3. This mapping corresponds to mapping from interior colors to cluster colors outside? Let's examine cluster outside ring: In input 4, outside cluster: \n- Row1: 2 at col6, 4 at col7\n- Row9: 3 at col7, 8 at col8\n- Row? 0? Wait, there are also 6? Actually, there is 6? Let's check input 4 again: \nRow1: 2 at col6, 4 at col7\nRow9: 3 at col7, 8 at col8\n\nSo outside cluster has colors 2,4,3,8. So mapping interior color 4->2? Wait, interior color 4 maps to output 2. So mapping 4->2. Yes. Interior color 8 maps to output 3. So mapping 8->3. Interior color 1 stays 1. So mapping 1->1. So mapping interior->outside cluster: 4->2, 8->3, 1->1. That matches mapping interior color to cluster color outside ring. So rule: For each interior color X, map to the color Y that appears outside ring.\n\nNow, in Example 1, mapping interior 4->1, interior 3->2. Outside cluster had colors 1,2,3,4. So mapping interior 4->1, interior 3->2. Good.\n\nIn Example 3, mapping interior 4->1, interior 2->3. Outside cluster had colors 1,4,3,2. So mapping interior 4->1, interior 2->3. Good.\n\nIn Example 2, mapping interior 5->4, 1->2, 8->6, 3->3. Outside cluster had colors 6,8,4,2,1,5. So mapping interior 5->4, 1->2, 8->6, 3->3. Good.\n\nSo the rule appears to be: Identify the largest rectangular ring of a single color. The ring encloses an interior region. There is also a cluster of cells outside the ring that contains a set of colors. For each color inside the ring, map it to the color that appears outside the ring that matches some mapping. The mapping is defined by the colors present in the cluster outside the ring. The mapping appears to be: For each color X inside the ring, find the color Y outside the ring that is the same numeric value? Wait, mapping interior 4->1: 4 inside ring maps to 1 outside ring. But 4 inside ring and 1 outside ring are different numeric values. So mapping is not numeric equality. It's mapping from interior color to a different color outside ring. But how is the mapping determined? It might be that each color inside ring corresponds to a color outside ring that is the same shape or position relative to something? But maybe the mapping is simply: For each interior color X, find the color Y that appears outside ring at the same relative location as X? But interior and outside cluster are not in same relative positions. But maybe there is a one-to-one mapping between interior colors and outside cluster colors based on the relative positions of their clusters. But let's examine Example 1: interior cluster: colors 4 and 3. Outside cluster: colors 1,2,3,4. But mapping interior 4->1, interior 3->2. So mapping interior 4->1 (color 1 outside cluster). interior 3->2 (color 2 outside cluster). So mapping interior color to outside color that is the same numeric value? Wait, 4->1 is not same numeric value. 3->2 is not same numeric value. So mapping is not numeric equality.\n\nMaybe mapping is based on relative positions: The cluster of 1,2,3,4 outside ring: They form a 2x2 cluster at positions (1,1),(1,2),(3,1),(3,2). But interior cluster of 4 and 3 is inside ring at positions relative to ring? Let's examine relative positions: The interior ring region is 4x4. The interior cluster of 4 and 3 is located at positions inside ring: \n- 4's at row7-10, col5-8. \n- 3's at row9-10, col5-8? Actually, interior region coordinates: row7-10, col5-8. \nPositions: \nRow7: 8,4,8,8\nRow8: 4,4,4,8\nRow9: 3,4,3,8\nRow10: 3,3,3,8\n\nSo interior cluster of 4: positions (row7,col6),(row8,col5),(row8,col6),(row8,col7),(row9,col6). Interiors of 3: positions (row9,col5),(row9,col7),(row10,col5),(row10,col6),(row10,col7). So interior cluster of 4 is at positions near top-left of interior, cluster of 3 near bottom-left. Outside cluster of 1,2,3,4: \nPositions: \n(1,1)=2\n(1,2)=3\n(3,1)=1\n(3,2)=4\n\nSo mapping interior 4->1: interior 4 cluster at top-left of interior, outside cluster 1 at (3,1). interior 3 cluster at bottom-left, outside cluster 2 at (1,1). So mapping seems to map interior cluster to outside cluster based on relative positions? But interior cluster 4 at top-left maps to outside cluster 1 at (3,1) which is bottom-left? Wait, maybe mapping is by shape: interior cluster of 4 is shape like a plus shape? Actually, interior cluster of 4: 5 cells: shape like T? Let's examine interior cluster of 4: coordinates relative to interior (0-index):\n(0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1). That's a cross shape. Outside cluster of 1: coordinates relative to cluster? Outside cluster of 1 at (3,1) only one cell. So not same shape. So mapping not shape-based.\n\nAlternatively, mapping may be based on numeric difference: interior 4 maps to 1 (difference -3). interior 3 maps to 2 (difference -1). But mapping interior 5->4 difference -1, interior 1->2 difference +1, interior 8->6 difference -2, interior 3->3 difference 0. So mapping differences vary.\n\nMaybe mapping is based on mapping of colors to the next color in the ring? Let's examine Example 2: ring color 3. Outside cluster has colors 6,8,4,2,1,5. But mapping interior 5->4: 5 inside ring maps to 4 outside ring. 5 and 4 are adjacent numeric values. 1 inside ring maps to 2 outside ring: 1->2 difference +1. 8 inside ring maps to 6 outside ring: 8->6 difference -2. 3 inside ring maps to 3 outside ring: 3->3 difference 0. So mapping seems to be mapping interior color to the color that is \"closest\" to it outside ring? Let's check: For interior 5, outside ring colors: 4,5,6,8,2,1. The nearest numeric difference to 5 is 4 or 6. They choose 4. For interior 1, nearest numeric difference to 1 is 2 or 4? Actually, 2 difference 1, 4 difference 3. They choose 2. For interior 8, nearest numeric difference to 8 is 6 difference 2, 5 difference 3, 4 difference 4, 2 difference 6, 1 difference 7. They choose 6. For interior 3, nearest numeric difference to 3 is 2 difference 1, 4 difference 1, 5 difference 2, 6 difference 3, 8 difference 5, 1 difference 2. They choose 3 itself, which is difference 0. So mapping chooses the nearest numeric difference, but if the same numeric difference, maybe choose the smaller? For interior 3, nearest difference 1: 2 or 4. They choose 3 itself. So they might choose the color with the smallest numeric difference, but if that difference is 0 (the same color), they choose that. So mapping interior 3->3. For interior 5, nearest difference 1: 4 or 6. They choose 4. So tie broken by something: maybe choose the smaller numeric value? 4 is smaller than 6. For interior 1, nearest difference 1: 2. Only one. So 2. For interior 8, nearest difference 2: 6 or 10? Actually 10 not present. 6 difference 2, 5 difference 3, 4 difference 4, 2 difference 6, 1 difference 7. So choose 6. So mapping chooses the nearest numeric difference, tie broken by smaller numeric value. That seems plausible.\n\nLet's test this rule for Example 1: interior colors: 4,3. Outside cluster colors: 1,2,3,4. For interior 4: nearest numeric difference: difference 0: 4 itself present. So mapping 4->4? But output mapping 4->1. So rule fails. Because mapping chooses 4->1, not 4->4. So not nearest numeric difference.\n\nMaybe mapping is based on mapping interior colors to the color that appears at the same relative position in the outside cluster as the interior color appears in the interior cluster? Let's examine Example 1: interior cluster of 4's at positions (0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1). Outside cluster of 1,2,3,4: positions: (1,1)=2, (1,2)=3, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=4. There's no direct mapping of positions. But maybe mapping is based on relative positions in the cluster: The interior cluster of 4's is symmetrical around center. The outside cluster of 1,2,3,4 has 1 at bottom-left, 2 at top-left, 3 at top-right, 4 at bottom-right. So maybe mapping interior 4->1 because interior cluster of 4's is located at top-left of interior region? But interior cluster of 4's is at top-left? Actually, interior cluster of 4's occupies positions: (0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1). So it's like a cross centered at (1,1). So it's not at top-left. But maybe mapping interior 4->1 because 1 is at bottom-left of outside cluster. Not clear.\n\nLet's examine Example 3: interior colors: 4 and 2. Outside cluster: 1,4,3,2. mapping: 4->1, 2->3. So mapping interior 4->1 (color 1 at outside cluster bottom-left). interior 2->3 (color 3 at outside cluster top-right). But not sure.\n\nLet's examine Example 4: interior colors: 4 and 8. Outside cluster: 2,4,3,8. mapping: 4->2, 8->3. So mapping interior 4->2 (color 2 at outside cluster left side?), 8->3 (color 3 at outside cluster right side?). But not clear.\n\nPerhaps the mapping is based on the order of colors outside ring sorted by numeric value? For Example 2: outside colors sorted: 1,2,4,5,6,8. The mapping: 5->4 (previous), 1->2 (next?), 8->6 (previous?), 3->3 (itself). That seems like mapping interior color to the color that is one step away in the sorted list? But not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mapping is based on the mapping of colors to the color that appears in the same relative position in the input as the interior color appears in the ring? Let's examine Example 2: interior color 5 appears at positions inside ring: (row7 col2-5) etc. Outside cluster 4 appears at (6,9). But 4 is not at same relative position. So no.\n\nMaybe mapping is based on the mapping of colors to the color that appears in the same relative position in the cluster outside ring as the interior color appears in the cluster inside ring? But interior cluster of 5's appears at positions (row7 col2-5). Outside cluster of 4 appears at (6,9). Not same relative position.\n\nAlternatively, mapping might be based on the mapping of colors to the color that appears in the same relative position in the ring as the interior color appears in the ring? But ring is all 3's. So not.\n\nLet's step back and think: The transformation might be: \"Replace the interior of the ring with a mapping of colors derived from the cluster outside the ring.\" The mapping might be: For each color inside the ring, replace it with the color that appears outside the ring at the same relative position in the ring? But no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mapping is derived from the cluster outside ring by rotating the cluster or flipping it and aligning with interior. But we need to find a consistent rule.\n\nLet's examine the shape of the cluster outside ring in each example. In Example 1, the cluster outside ring is a 2x2 block of 1,2,3,4. In Example 2, the cluster outside ring is a 2x2 block of 6,8,4,2,1,5? Actually, it's a 2x3 block? Let's examine: Outside ring cluster coordinates: (2,5)=6, (2,6)=8, (4,9)=2, (4,10)=1, (6,9)=4, (6,10)=5. That's a 3x2 cluster? Actually, coordinates: (2,5),(2,6),(4,9),(4,10),(6,9),(6,10). They form two separate 2x1 blocks? Actually, (2,5),(2,6) is a horizontal pair. (4,9),(4,10) is a horizontal pair. (6,9),(6,10) is a horizontal pair. So it's three separate horizontal pairs. But maybe we consider the cluster as a set of pairs? But mapping interior 5->4 uses cluster 4 at (6,9). But 5 appears at (6,10). So mapping 5->4 uses the pair at (6,9),(6,10). So mapping 5->4 uses the neighbor to the left of 5 in the pair. Similarly, mapping 1->2 uses the pair at (4,9),(4,10). 1 at (4,10) maps to 2 at (4,9). So mapping interior 1->2 uses the neighbor to the left. Mapping 8->6 uses the pair at (2,5),(2,6). 8 at (2,6) maps to 6 at (2,5). So mapping interior 8->6 uses the neighbor to the left. Mapping 3->3 uses 3 at (6,9)? Wait, 3 appears at (6,9) inside ring? Actually, 3 appears at (6,9) outside ring? Wait, 3 appears at (6,9) outside ring? But 3 is part of the ring? Wait, 3 is ring color. So mapping 3->3 is trivial. But we also have 3 at (6,9) outside ring? Wait, check: row6: \"0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\". So 3 at col1-7. So 3 at (6,9) is not present. So 3 appears only inside ring. So mapping 3->3 is trivial.\n\nThus mapping interior 5->4 uses the neighbor to the left of 5 in the outside cluster. Similarly, mapping interior 1->2 uses neighbor to left of 1. mapping 8->6 uses neighbor to left of 8. So mapping might be: For each interior color X, find the color Y that is adjacent to X in the outside cluster in a specific orientation (like left neighbor). But why left? Because the outside cluster is arranged in horizontal pairs with the smaller color on the left? Let's check: In each pair, the left color is smaller? (2,5)=6, (2,6)=8: left 6 smaller than right 8. (4,9)=2, (4,10)=1: left 2 larger than right 1. (6,9)=4, (6,10)=5: left 4 smaller than right 5. So left neighbor not always smaller. So not numeric.\n\nBut mapping interior 5->4 uses left neighbor 4. mapping interior 1->2 uses left neighbor 2. mapping interior 8->6 uses left neighbor 6. So mapping interior X->Y uses the left neighbor in the pair. So maybe the rule: For each interior color X, find the pair of adjacent cells outside ring where X is on the right side. Then map X to the left neighbor's color. That seems plausible. Let's test with Example 1: Outside cluster pairs: (1,1)=2, (1,2)=3? Actually, cluster of 1,2,3,4 is a 2x2 block. But we can think of pairs: (1,1)=2, (1,2)=3; (3,1)=1, (3,2)=4. So we have pairs (2,3) and (1,4). For interior 4 mapping to 1: 4 appears at (3,2). The pair (1,4) has 4 at right, 1 at left. So mapping 4->1. For interior 3 mapping to 2: 3 appears at (1,2). The pair (2,3) has 3 at right, 2 at left. So mapping 3->2. That matches. Good. For interior 2 mapping? interior 2 appears at (1,1). But 2 appears at left of pair (2,3). But mapping rule says if X appears on right side of pair, map to left neighbor. But 2 appears on left side, so maybe mapping 2->? But interior 2 not present? Wait, interior 2 appears at (1,1)? Actually, interior 2 appears at (1,1) inside ring? Let's check interior of ring in Example 1: interior region rows7-10, cols5-8. There is no 2 inside interior. So mapping rule only applies to interior colors that appear on the right side of a pair in outside cluster. That matches: interior 4 appears on right side of pair (1,4). interior 3 appears on right side of pair (2,3). So mapping rule works.\n\nNow, Example 3: Outside cluster pairs: We have cluster at (7,1)=1, (7,2)=4 (horizontal pair). Also cluster at (9,7)=3, (9,8)=2 (horizontal pair). So pairs: (1,4) and (3,2). For interior 4 mapping to 1: interior 4 appears at right side of pair (1,4). So mapping 4->1. For interior 2 mapping to 3: interior 2 appears at right side of pair (3,2). So mapping 2->3. Good.\n\nExample 4: Outside cluster pairs: (1,6)=2, (1,7)=4 (horizontal pair). (9,7)=3, (9,8)=8 (horizontal pair). So pairs: (2,4) and (3,8). For interior 4 mapping to 2: interior 4 appears on right side of pair (2,4). So mapping 4->2. For interior 8 mapping to 3: interior 8 appears on right side of pair (3,8). So mapping 8->3. Good.\n\nSo the mapping rule appears to be: For each interior color X, find a pair of adjacent cells outside the ring (in the cluster outside ring). The pair has two colors, say A and B. If X equals B (the right cell), map X to A (the left cell). If X equals A (the left cell), maybe no mapping? But interior X appears only on the right side of the pair? Let's check: In Example 1, interior 3 appears on right side of pair (2,3). interior 4 appears on right side of pair (1,4). In Example 2, interior 5 appears on right side of pair (4,5). interior 1 appears on right side of pair (2,1). interior 8 appears on right side of pair (6,8). So indeed, interior colors appear on the right side of pairs. In Example 3, interior 4 appears on right side of pair (1,4). interior 2 appears on right side of pair (3,2). In Example 4, interior 4 appears on right side of pair (2,4). interior 8 appears on right side of pair (3,8). So mapping rule: For each interior color X that appears on the right side of a pair of adjacent cells outside the ring, replace X with the color of the left cell of that pair.\n\nThus, the mapping is defined by the adjacency of colors in the cluster outside the ring. Each pair of adjacent cells (two cells side by side horizontally) outside the ring defines a mapping from the right cell's color to the left cell's color. Then we apply that mapping to the interior of the ring.\n\nBut is the cluster outside ring always a set of horizontal pairs? Let's check each example: \n- Example 1: cluster of 1,2,3,4 is a 2x2 block, not horizontal pairs. But we can view it as two horizontal pairs: (2,3) on row1, and (1,4) on row3. But the cluster includes also vertical adjacency (2 below 1, 3 below 4). But we only consider horizontal pairs. \n- Example 2: cluster of 6,8,4,2,1,5 are arranged as horizontal pairs: (6,8) on row2, (2,1) on row4, (4,5) on row6. \n- Example 3: cluster of 1,4 on row7, and 3,2 on row9. \n- Example 4: cluster of 2,4 on row1, and 3,8 on row9. \nSo yes, cluster outside ring appears as horizontal pairs. So mapping rule uses horizontal pairs.\n\nNow, we need to confirm that interior colors appear on the right side of pairs. Let's check Example 2: interior 5 appears on right side of pair (4,5). interior 1 appears on right side of pair (2,1). interior 8 appears on right side of pair (6,8). interior 3 appears on right side? 3 appears inside ring but also outside ring? But interior 3 is ring color, so mapping not needed. So mapping works.\n\nThus, the transformation: \n- Identify the largest rectangular ring of a single color (the ring).\n- Identify the cluster of cells outside the ring that form horizontal pairs (two adjacent cells horizontally). \n- For each pair (A,B) (left, right), map color B to color A. \n- For each cell inside the ring (excluding the ring border), replace its color with the mapped color (if the color is mapped). If the color is not in mapping, maybe keep it? But in all examples, all interior colors were mapped. In Example 2, interior 3 (ring color) stays 3. In Example 1, interior 8 stays 8. In Example 3, interior 8 stays 8. In Example 4, interior 1 stays 1. So mapping includes mapping for interior colors that are not ring color. For ring color, we keep it. For interior colors that are not mapped, maybe we keep them? But in examples, all interior colors were mapped. But we should consider if interior color not mapped remains unchanged. But likely mapping covers all interior colors that appear.\n\nNow, we need to apply this rule to the test input. Let's analyze test input.\n\nTest Input grid: 13x13. Let's write it out row by row:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 1 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 1 3 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 1 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 1 7 7 7 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 1 1 7 1 1 0 0 4 8 0 0\nRow8: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 0 0 0 0\nRow11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's identify the ring. The ring seems to be a rectangle of 1's at rows3-8, cols2-6? Let's check: \nRows 3-8, cols2-6: \nRow3: 1 1 3 1 1 at cols2-6? Actually, row3: \"0 0 1 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> col2=1, col3=1, col4=3, col5=1, col6=1. So row3 has 1 at col2,3,5,6; 3 at col4. \nRow4: \"0 0 1 3 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> col2=1, col3=3, col4=3, col5=3, col6=1. \nRow5: \"0 0 1 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> col2=1, col3=8, col4=8, col5=8, col6=1.\nRow6: \"0 0 1 7 7 7 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> col2=1, col3=7, col4=7, col5=7, col6=1.\nRow7: \"0 0 1 1 7 1 1 0 0 4 8 0 0\" -> col2=1, col3=1, col4=7, col5=1, col6=1, col9=4, col10=8.\nRow8: \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> col2=1, col3=1, col4=1, col5=1, col6=1.\n\nSo there is a 6x5 rectangle of mostly 1's with interior colors 3,8,7,4,8. But the ring of 1's is not a perfect ring because there are interior 1's inside the rectangle? Actually, the rectangle is 6 rows tall (rows3-8) and 5 columns wide (cols2-6). The border of this rectangle: top row (row3): 1,1,3,1,1. bottom row (row8): 1,1,1,1,1. Left column (col2): 1,1,1,1,1,1. Right column (col6): 1,1,1,1,1,1. So the border is all 1's except the top row has a 3 at col4? Wait, top row row3: 1 at col2, 1 at col3, 3 at col4, 1 at col5, 1 at col6. So the border has a 3 at top row col4. So border is not all 1's. So maybe the ring is not the 1's. But maybe the ring is of 1's but with interior 3 at top? But ring must be uniform color? In previous examples, the ring was uniform color: 8 in Example 1, 3 in Example 2, 8 in Example 3, 1 in Example 4. So maybe ring is uniform color. But here the border of 1's has a 3 at top row col4. That breaks uniformity. So maybe the ring is not 1's. Let's check if there's any other uniform border.\n\nLook at the shape: There is a rectangular region of 1's at rows3-8, cols2-6. The border of that region is 1's except at top row col4. So maybe the ring is not that rectangle. Maybe there's a ring of 1's but with a 3 inside the ring? But ring must be uniform color, so maybe the ring is of color 1 but with a 3 inside the ring, but we consider the ring as the border of 1's ignoring the 3 inside? But the 3 at top row col4 is part of the border. But maybe the ring is not the 1's region but something else.\n\nLet's examine the entire input: There is a cluster of 2 and 3 at row1: 2 at col8, 3 at col9. That is a small cluster outside ring? There's also cluster of 4,8 at row7 col9-10. There's cluster of 6,7 at row10 col7-8. There are interior colors 3,8,7,4,8 inside the 1's rectangle. So maybe the ring is of 1's but the 3 at top row col4 is considered as part of interior? But the ring border includes that 3, but maybe we treat that 3 as interior because it's not part of the ring border? But the ring border is defined by the outermost cells of the rectangle, which includes that 3. But if we treat that 3 as interior, we would have a ring of 1's with interior 3 at top row col4? But the ring border would then be 1's at all positions except that interior 3. But the ring border is not contiguous: the 3 is inside the border, not on the border. But the 3 is at row3 col4, which is the top border of the rectangle. So if we treat that 3 as interior, the ring border would be 1's at row3 col2,3,5,6; row4 col2,6; row5 col2,6; row6 col2,6; row7 col2,3,5,6; row8 col2-6. But that would leave a missing cell at top border col4. But ring border would not be continuous. So maybe the ring is not that rectangle.\n\nLet's look for a uniform border of a single color that encloses a region. In Example 1, ring of 8. In Example 2, ring of 3. In Example 3, ring of 8. In Example 4, ring of 1. So maybe in test input, the ring is of 1's as well. Let's check if there's a rectangle of 1's that encloses an interior region. We see a rectangle of 1's at rows3-8, cols2-6. That is a 6x5 rectangle. The border of that rectangle: top row row3 col2-6: 1,1,3,1,1. So not uniform. But maybe the ring is of 1's but the 3 is considered as interior? But the border must be uniform for mapping rule. But maybe the ring is of 1's but the 3 at top border is inside the ring, not part of the border. But the border must be contiguous 1's. But the 3 at top border would break that. But maybe the ring is not rectangular? Maybe it's an irregular shape of 1's that encloses interior region. Let's inspect the shape of 1's:\n\nPositions of 1's:\n- Row3: col2,3,5,6\n- Row4: col2,6\n- Row5: col2,6\n- Row6: col2,6\n- Row7: col2,3,5,6\n- Row8: col2,3,4,5,6\n\nSo shape of 1's: \nRow3: 1 1 . 1 1\nRow4: 1 . . . 1\nRow5: 1 . . . 1\nRow6: 1 . . . 1\nRow7: 1 1 . 1 1\nRow8: 1 1 1 1 1\n\nThis shape is not a perfect rectangle border; it has missing cells at row3 col4 and row4-7 col3,4,5? Actually, row4-7 col3-5 are missing 1's. So shape is like a ring but with missing cells in the middle. But maybe the ring is defined by the outermost 1's that form a border: The outermost shape of 1's encloses an interior region. Let's find the outermost boundary of 1's: The bounding box of 1's is rows3-8, cols2-6. The outermost cells of that bounding box: \n- Top row: row3 col2-6: 1,1,3,1,1\n- Bottom row: row8 col2-6: 1,1,1,1,1\n- Left column: col2 rows3-8: 1,1,1,1,1,1\n- Right column: col6 rows3-8: 1,1,1,1,1,1\n\nSo the outer boundary of 1's includes a 3 at row3 col4. But maybe we consider that 3 as part of interior region, not part of border. But the ring border would then be 1's at all outer boundary positions except that one missing cell. But that missing cell breaks continuity. But maybe we consider the ring border as the set of 1's that form a closed shape, ignoring the 3. But the 3 is inside the shape but on the border? But maybe we treat the 3 as part of interior region because it's not part of the ring border. But the ring border might not be contiguous. But maybe the ring is not the 1's rectangle but something else.\n\nLet's examine the shape of 3's: There is a 3 at row1 col8, row1 col9? Actually, row1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0\" -> 2 at col8, 3 at col9. So 3 at row1 col9. There is also a 3 at row7 col? Actually, row7: \"0 0 1 1 7 1 1 0 0 4 8 0 0\" -> no 3. Row8: no 3. Row9: none. Row10: no 3. So only 3 at row1 col9. So no ring of 3's.\n\nShape of 2's: 2 at row1 col8. Only one 2. So not ring.\n\nShape of 4's: 4 at row7 col9. Only one 4. So not ring.\n\nShape of 6's: 6 at row10 col7. Only one 6. So not ring.\n\nShape of 7's: 7 at row10 col8? Actually, row10: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 0 0 0 0\" -> 6 at col7, 7 at col8. So 7 at row10 col8. Also 7 at row6 col3-5? Wait, row6: \"0 0 1 7 7 7 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> 7 at col3,4,5. Row7: \"0 0 1 1 7 1 1 0 0 4 8 0 0\" -> 7 at col4. So 7 appears at multiple positions: row6 col3-5, row7 col4, row10 col8. So 7 forms a cluster of 4 cells: (row6,3),(row6,4),(row6,5),(row7,4). So shape of 7's is like a T shape: a horizontal line of 3 at row6 col3-5, with a vertical extension down at col4 row7. So not ring.\n\nSo the only candidate for a ring is the 1's rectangle. But the border of 1's is not uniform due to the 3 at row3 col4. But maybe the ring is defined by 1's but we consider the 3 at row3 col4 as part of interior region, not part of border. But then the border is incomplete. But maybe the ring is not defined by uniform color, but by shape: the outermost shape of 1's encloses an interior region. The interior region includes the 3 at row3 col4. But the ring border includes 1's at all outermost positions except that missing cell. But maybe the ring border is considered as the outermost shape of 1's ignoring the missing cell. But the mapping rule may still apply: we identify the cluster outside the ring: the cluster outside ring includes 2 at row1 col8, 3 at row1 col9, 4 at row7 col9, 8 at row7 col10, 6 at row10 col7, 7 at row10 col8. These are the only non-1 colors. Are they arranged as horizontal pairs? Let's check: \n- 2 at row1 col8, 3 at row1 col9: horizontal pair (2,3). \n- 4 at row7 col9, 8 at row7 col10: horizontal pair (4,8). \n- 6 at row10 col7, 7 at row10 col8: horizontal pair (6,7). \nSo yes, the cluster outside ring consists of three horizontal pairs: (2,3), (4,8), (6,7). So mapping rule: For each pair (A,B), map B->A. So mapping: 3->2, 8->4, 7->6. Also, maybe 3 appears inside ring? Yes, interior 3 at row3 col4. So interior 3 should map to 2. Also, interior 8? There is 8 at row7 col10? Actually, 8 at row7 col10 is outside ring, not interior. But interior 8? There is no 8 inside ring. There is 8 at row7 col10 outside ring. There is 8 at row7 col10 outside ring. But interior 8? There is no 8 inside ring. There is 7 at row7 col4 inside ring? Wait, 7 at row7 col4 is inside ring. So interior 7 should map to 6. Also, interior 3 at row3 col4 should map to 2. Also, interior 8? None. Also, interior 4? None. So interior colors inside ring: 3,7? Let's list all interior cells inside ring: The ring is the rectangle of 1's bounding box rows3-8, cols2-6. The interior region is rows4-7, cols3-5 (since border is row3 and row8, col2 and col6). So interior cells: \nRow4: col3=3, col4=3, col5=3\nRow5: col3=8, col4=8, col5=8\nRow6: col3=7, col4=7, col5=7\nRow7: col3=1, col4=7, col5=1? Wait, row7: \"0 0 1 1 7 1 1 0 0 4 8 0 0\" -> col2=1, col3=1, col4=7, col5=1, col6=1. So interior row7: col3=1, col4=7, col5=1. But interior region includes rows4-7, cols3-5. So row7 col3=1, col4=7, col5=1. So interior cells: \n- Row4: 3,3,3\n- Row5: 8,8,8\n- Row6: 7,7,7\n- Row7: 1,7,1\n\nSo interior colors: 3,8,7,1. But 1 is ring color? Actually, ring color is 1. So interior 1 should stay 1. But interior 3 maps to 2, interior 8 maps to 4? Wait, mapping from pairs: (2,3) maps 3->2. (4,8) maps 8->4. (6,7) maps 7->6. So interior 3 -> 2, interior 8 -> 4, interior 7 -> 6, interior 1 stays 1. So interior after mapping: \nRow4: 2,2,2\nRow5: 4,4,4\nRow6: 6,6,6\nRow7: 1,6,1\n\nNow, the output should be the ring region including border of 1's and interior mapped. So output grid size: same as ring bounding box: 6 rows (rows3-8) and 5 columns (cols2-6). So output 6x5. Outer border: all 1's? But we need to check if outer border remains 1's? In previous examples, outer border remained the ring color. So outer border should remain 1's. But we need to check if the outer border includes the 3 at row3 col4? But we treat that 3 as interior. So the outer border should be all 1's. So output border: row0 of output (representing row3 of input) should be all 1's: 1 1 1 1 1. Row5 of output (representing row8 of input) should be all 1's: 1 1 1 1 1. Similarly, left column (col0 of output) should be all 1's: 1,1,1,1,1,1. Right column (col4 of output) should be all 1's: 1,1,1,1,1,1. So outer border of output: 1's.\n\nNow interior: rows1-4 of output correspond to interior rows4-7 of input. And columns1-3 of output correspond to interior columns3-5 of input. So interior mapping we computed: \n- Output row1 (representing input row4 interior): 2,2,2\n- Output row2 (representing input row5 interior): 4,4,4\n- Output row3 (representing input row6 interior): 6,6,6\n- Output row4 (representing input row7 interior): 1,6,1\n\nThus output grid 6x5:\nRow0: 1 1 1 1 1\nRow1: 1 2 2 2 1? Wait, we need to place interior in correct columns: Outer border columns 0 and 4 are 1. So interior columns 1-3 are the mapped interior. So row1: col0=1, col1=2, col2=2, col3=2, col4=1.\nRow2: col0=1, col1=4, col2=4, col3=4, col4=1.\nRow3: col0=1, col1=6, col2=6, col3=6, col4=1.\nRow4: col0=1, col1=1, col2=6, col3=1, col4=1.\nRow5: 1 1 1 1 1.\n\nBut we need to check the shape of ring: In test input, the ring border has a missing 1 at row3 col4 originally, but we treat that as interior. So output border is all 1's. But does the ring border in input have a 1 at row3 col4? Actually, input row3 col4=3, not 1. So border had a 3. But we treat that as interior. So output border will have 1 at that position. So output border will differ from input border. That matches mapping rule: we replace interior with mapping, but border stays ring color. But border originally had a 3 at that position, but we treat that as interior, so border will be 1. That seems plausible.\n\nNow, we need to check if the interior mapping we computed matches the mapping rule from examples. In examples, mapping interior color to left neighbor of pair outside ring. So interior 3->2, interior 8->4, interior 7->6. That matches mapping rule. So interior mapping is correct.\n\nNow, we need to confirm that we didn't miss any interior cells: interior region rows4-7, cols3-5 inclusive. We listed them. Good.\n\nNow, we need to produce the output grid. But we need to check if the output grid is 6x5 or maybe 6x5? Let's check the size of ring bounding box: rows3-8 inclusive (6 rows), cols2-6 inclusive (5 columns). So output grid should be 6 rows x 5 columns. So we produce 6x5 grid. Let's write it as lines of numbers separated by spaces.\n\nRow0: 1 1 1 1 1\nRow1: 1 2 2 2 1\nRow2: 1 4 4 4 1\nRow3: 1 6 6 6 1\nRow4: 1 1 6 1 1\nRow5: 1 1 1 1 1\n\nWait, row4 interior we computed: 1,6,1. So row4: col0=1, col1=1, col2=6, col3=1, col4=1. Yes.\n\nDouble-check interior mapping: \n- Input interior row4 (row4 col3-5): 3,3,3. Map 3->2. So row4 interior becomes 2,2,2. So row4 output: 1 2 2 2 1. Wait, we need to check mapping: Input row4 col3=3, col4=3, col5=3. So interior row4 should map to 2,2,2. So row4 output should be 1 2 2 2 1. But earlier we said row1 output: 1 2 2 2 1. But that would be row1 output. But we need to map row indices: \n- Input row4 corresponds to output row1? Wait, output row1 corresponds to input row4 interior. Because output row0 is border row3, output row5 is border row8. So output row1 corresponds to input row4 interior. So output row1 interior should be 2,2,2. So output row1: 1 2 2 2 1. Good.\n\n- Input row5 corresponds to output row2 interior: 8,8,8 -> map to 4,4,4. So output row2: 1 4 4 4 1.\n\n- Input row6 corresponds to output row3 interior: 7,7,7 -> map to 6,6,6. So output row3: 1 6 6 6 1.\n\n- Input row7 corresponds to output row4 interior: 1,7,1 -> map 1->1, 7->6, 1->1. So output row4: 1 1 6 1 1.\n\n- Output row5: border row8: all 1's.\n\nThus final output grid:\n\nRow0: 1 1 1 1 1\nRow1: 1 2 2 2 1\nRow2: 1 4 4 4 1\nRow3: 1 6 6 6 1\nRow4: 1 1 6 1 1\nRow5: 1 1 1 1 1\n\nLet's double-check if there are any other interior cells we missed: The interior region is rows4-7, cols3-5 inclusive. We have 4 rows, 3 columns. We covered them.\n\nNow, let's verify that the mapping rule indeed uses horizontal pairs. In test input, we have horizontal pairs: (2,3), (4,8), (6,7). So mapping: 3->2, 8->4, 7->6. Good.\n\nNow, we need to check if any interior cell is 8? We had interior 8 at row5 col3-5. That maps to 4. Good. No interior cell is 4. Good.\n\nNow, we need to check if any interior cell is 2? None. Good.\n\nNow, we need to check if interior cell 1 stays 1. Yes.\n\nThus final output grid: 6x5 with border 1's, interior mapping as above.\n\nBut we need to ensure that we didn't misinterpret the ring border: The ring border might not be all 1's because of the 3 at row3 col4. But we treat that as interior. So border becomes all 1's. But is that consistent with examples? In Example 1, the ring border had no interior color because it was all 8's. In Example 2, ring border all 3's. In Example 3, ring border all 8's. In Example 4, ring border all 1's. So ring border always uniform. So if input ring border is not uniform, maybe we need to find a different ring. But maybe the ring is not the rectangle of 1's but something else. Let's re-examine the input shape of 1's: It might be a ring with missing cells at row3 col4. But maybe the ring is not the outermost shape of 1's but a smaller ring inside? Let's examine the shape of 1's: \n- Outer border: row3 col2-6: 1,1,3,1,1\n- Row4 col2=1, col6=1\n- Row5 col2=1, col6=1\n- Row6 col2=1, col6=1\n- Row7 col2=1, col3=1, col5=1, col6=1\n- Row8 col2-6: 1,1,1,1,1\n\nSo the shape of 1's is like a rectangle with a missing cell at row3 col4. But maybe we can consider the ring as the shape formed by 1's ignoring that missing cell. But the missing cell breaks the ring. But maybe the ring is defined by the shape of 1's ignoring that missing cell: the ring border is the outermost 1's, but the missing cell is considered part of interior. So ring border would be all 1's except that missing cell. But we treat that missing cell as interior. So border is not uniform? But we can still treat the ring border as all 1's except the missing cell. But we need to decide if we consider that missing cell part of interior or border. In the examples, the ring border is uniform. So if we have a missing cell in the border, we might need to consider that the ring is not the shape of 1's but a different shape. But maybe there is another ring shape in the input: maybe ring of 1's but with interior 3 at top row col4? But no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ring is of color 1 but we consider the missing cell as part of interior, so ring border is still all 1's except that missing cell. But the mapping rule might still apply: we map interior colors to left neighbor of pairs outside ring. But the ring border may not be uniform. But maybe we need to consider the ring border as the set of 1's that form a closed shape. But if there's a missing cell, the shape is not closed. But maybe the missing cell is considered part of interior region and we treat the ring border as the set of 1's that form a closed shape around the interior region. But is there a closed shape? Let's check: The shape of 1's might be a ring with a hole at row3 col4. But that hole is inside the ring shape. But the ring shape is still closed: the shape of 1's encloses a region that includes that hole. But the hole is at row3 col4, which is interior. So the ring border is all 1's at the outer boundary: row3 col2,3,5,6; row4 col2,6; row5 col2,6; row6 col2,6; row7 col2,3,5,6; row8 col2-6. That shape encloses an interior region that includes the missing cell at row3 col4. So the ring border is indeed all 1's at those positions. So the ring border is uniform 1's. The missing cell at row3 col4 is interior. So the ring border is uniform 1's. So we can treat the ring border as uniform 1's. So output border will be all 1's.\n\nThus the mapping rule is consistent.\n\nNow, we need to check if there are any interior cells that are not mapped because they are not part of any mapping pair. But we have mapping pairs for 3,8,7. So interior 3,8,7 will map. Interiors 1 stays 1. So all interior cells are mapped or remain same.\n\nThus output grid is as above.\n\nBut we need to double-check the mapping rule: For each pair (A,B) outside ring, map B->A. We found pairs: (2,3), (4,8), (6,7). So mapping: 3->2, 8->4, 7->6. Yes. But we also need to consider that the mapping might be symmetrical: For each pair, map B->A and maybe also map A->B? But in examples, mapping only used one direction: interior color B mapped to A. For interior color A, if it appears inside ring, maybe we map it to B? But interior 2,4,6,1? But interior 2,4,6,1 didn't appear. So we can't test. But maybe mapping includes both directions? But mapping of interior 2 would map to 3? But interior 2 not present. But we can test: In Example 2, interior 3 is ring color, but we didn't map it. But interior 3 is also present as B in pair (6,8)? Actually, 3 is not part of pair (6,8). But 3 appears in pair (4,5)? Wait, no. In Example 2, pairs: (6,8), (2,1), (4,5). So 3 is not part of any pair. So mapping of 3 is trivial. So mapping rule only uses interior colors that are B in some pair. So mapping is one-direction.\n\nThus, we can produce the output.\n\nBut we need to ensure we didn't mis-interpret the ring. Let's double-check the ring shape in test input: The ring is the 1's shape. It encloses an interior region of 3 rows? Actually, interior region is rows4-7, cols3-5. That region has 4 rows and 3 columns. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that the mapping of interior colors to left neighbor of pair outside ring is correct. Let's check each interior color:\n\n- Interior 3 at row4 col3-5. This maps to 2 because of pair (2,3). Good.\n\n- Interior 8 at row5 col3-5. This maps to 4 because of pair (4,8). Good.\n\n- Interior 7 at row6 col3-5. This maps to 6 because of pair (6,7). Good.\n\n- Interior 1 at row7 col3 and col5. This stays 1 because it's ring color. Good.\n\nThus mapping is consistent.\n\nNow, let's verify if any interior cell is 3 but also part of ring border? Actually, interior 3 is inside ring, but ring border has no 3. Good.\n\nNow, we need to produce the output grid. But we need to confirm the output size: 6x5. But the examples output sizes varied: Example 1: 6x6, Example 2: 7x7, Example 3: 4x7, Example 4: 4x4. They matched the ring size. So output size is ring bounding box. So we produce 6x5.\n\nBut we need to check if the output border includes the ring color all around. In Example 1, border all 8's. In Example 2, border all 3's. In Example 3, border all 8's. In Example 4, border all 1's. So yes, border is ring color.\n\nThus output border all 1's.\n\nNow, we need to confirm that the interior mapping we computed yields a grid that matches pattern of interior mapping from examples. In examples, interior mapping produced a pattern that sometimes had repeated values and some values at edges. But our mapping yields a pattern: \nRow1: 1 2 2 2 1\nRow2: 1 4 4 4 1\nRow3: 1 6 6 6 1\nRow4: 1 1 6 1 1\n\nThis pattern seems plausible.\n\nNow, we need to check if there might be any other ring in the input that we might have missed. For example, maybe there's a ring of 1's but inside that ring there's a smaller ring of 1's? But no.\n\nBut let's check if there's any ring of 1's that encloses interior region of 3,8,7. That is the ring we identified. So output should be that.\n\nNow, we need to produce the output grid. Let's format as lines of numbers separated by spaces.\n\nThus final output:\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 2 2 1\n1 4 4 4 1\n1 6 6 6 1\n1 1 6 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nWe need to ensure we didn't mis-order rows. Let's double-check mapping of rows:\n\n- Output row0: border row3 of input: 1 1 1 1 1\n- Output row1: interior row4: 1 2 2 2 1\n- Output row2: interior row5: 1 4 4 4 1\n- Output row3: interior row6: 1 6 6 6 1\n- Output row4: interior row7: 1 1 6 1 1\n- Output row5: border row8: 1 1 1 1 1\n\nYes.\n\nNow, we need to check if the interior mapping of row7 (input row7) should be 1 1 6 1 1? Let's double-check: Input row7 col3=1, col4=7, col5=1. So interior row7: 1,7,1. Map 1->1, 7->6, 1->1. So row7 interior: 1,6,1. So output row4 interior: 1,6,1. So output row4: 1 1 6 1 1. Good.\n\nNow, check if any interior cell is 8? We mapped 8->4. So row5 interior: 8,8,8 -> 4,4,4. So output row2 interior: 4,4,4. Good.\n\nNow, check if any interior cell is 3? Yes, row4 interior: 3,3,3 -> 2,2,2. So output row1 interior: 2,2,2. Good.\n\nNow, check if any interior cell is 7? Yes, row6 interior: 7,7,7 -> 6,6,6. So output row3 interior: 6,6,6. Good.\n\nThus mapping is consistent.\n\nNow, we need to confirm that we didn't misinterpret the ring shape. Let's check the shape of 1's again to confirm that the ring border is indeed the set of 1's at positions:\n\n- Top row: row3 col2,3,5,6\n- Bottom row: row8 col2-6\n- Left column: col2 rows3-8\n- Right column: col6 rows3-8\n- Additional 1's at row7 col3 and row7 col5: but those are inside ring? Actually, row7 col3 and col5 are interior cells, not border. But they are 1's inside interior region. But interior region is rows4-7, cols3-5. So row7 col3 and col5 are interior. So interior 1's are allowed. So border remains all 1's at those positions. Good.\n\nNow, we need to check if any interior cell is 1 that might be mapped incorrectly. But interior 1 remains 1.\n\nNow, we need to check if there might be any other ring of 1's inside the interior region that encloses a smaller interior region. But interior region has 1's at row7 col3 and col5. But those 1's might form a ring of 1's? But they are just two cells. Not a ring.\n\nNow, we need to check if the mapping rule might apply to the interior of the ring of 1's but not to the interior 1's. But we treat interior 1's as ring color and keep them unchanged. That matches examples: In Example 1, interior 8 remained 8. In Example 2, interior 3 remained 3. In Example 3, interior 8 remained 8. In Example 4, interior 1 remained 1.\n\nThus, we keep interior 1's unchanged.\n\nNow, we need to check if any interior 1's appear in examples. Example 1: interior had 8's, no 1's. Example 2: interior had 3's, no 1's. Example 3: interior had 8's, no 1's. Example 4: interior had 1's. Yes, Example 4 interior had 1's at positions (2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3). They remained 1. So yes.\n\nNow, we need to confirm that the mapping rule is consistent: For each pair (A,B) outside ring, map B->A. So we need to check if there is any interior color that is not B in any pair. But we have interior colors: 3,8,7,1. 3 is B in pair (2,3). 8 is B in pair (4,8). 7 is B in pair (6,7). 1 is not B in any pair, but it's ring color. So mapping covers all interior colors.\n\nThus output mapping is correct.\n\nNow, we need to produce final output grid. But we need to check if there is any nuance: The mapping might also involve mapping of interior color to left neighbor of pair outside ring, but if interior color appears multiple times in ring, we map each instance accordingly. That's what we did.\n\nNow, we need to check if there might be any interior color that appears on left side of pair outside ring. But interior color 2 or 4 or 6 appear in interior? None. So no.\n\nNow, we need to check if mapping of interior 3 to 2 might also map interior 3 to 2. Good.\n\nNow, we need to check if there might be any interior color that appears on both sides of pair outside ring. But not.\n\nThus final output grid is as we computed.\n\nNow, let's check if the output grid matches any pattern from examples: In Example 4, interior mapping produced pattern with 3's and 2's. In test output, interior mapping produced pattern with 2,4,6. That seems plausible.\n\nNow, we need to produce final answer: the output grid.\n\nThus final answer:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 2 2 1\n1 4 4 4 1\n1 6 6 6 1\n1 1 6 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nBut we need to double-check the output grid size: 6 rows x 5 columns. Yes.\n\nNow, let's double-check the mapping of interior 7 at row6 col3-5: 7->6. So row6 interior: 6,6,6. So output row3 interior: 6,6,6. Good.\n\nNow, we need to double-check that we didn't mis-index row numbers: In output, row3 interior corresponds to input row6 interior. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to double-check that we didn't mis-index the output columns: The output columns 1-3 correspond to input columns 3-5. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to double-check that we didn't mis-index output rows: Output row0 corresponds to input row3 border. Output row5 corresponds to input row8 border. Yes.\n\nThus final output grid is correct.\n\nNow, we need to produce the final answer. But before we finalize, we should double-check that the ring border indeed includes all 1's at those positions. Let's re-check input 1-8 rows:\n\nRow3: 0 0 1 1 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIndices: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. So row3 col2=1, col3=1, col4=3, col5=1, col6=1. So border at row3: col2,3,5,6 are 1's. Good.\n\nRow4: 0 0 1 3 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIndices: col2=1, col3=3, col4=3, col5=3, col6=1. So border at row4: col2=1, col6=1. Good.\n\nRow5: 0 0 1 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIndices: col2=1, col3=8, col4=8, col5=8, col6=1. So border at row5: col2=1, col6=1. Good.\n\nRow6: 0 0 1 7 7 7 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIndices: col2=1, col3=7, col4=7, col5=7, col6=1. So border at row6: col2=1, col6=1. Good.\n\nRow7: 0 0 1 1 7 1 1 0 0 4 8 0 0\nIndices: col2=1, col3=1, col4=7, col5=1, col6=1, col7=0, col8=0, col9=4, col10=8. So border at row7: col2=1, col3=1, col5=1, col6=1. But row7 col3 and col5 are interior? Actually, interior region is rows4-7, cols3-5. So row7 col3 and col5 are interior. But border at row7 includes col2 and col6. So border at row7: col2=1, col6=1. So border at row7: 1 at col2, 1 at col6. Good.\n\nRow8: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIndices: col2=1, col3=1, col4=1, col5=1, col6=1. So border at row8: col2-6 all 1's. Good.\n\nThus border of ring is all 1's at positions: row3 col2,3,5,6; row4 col2,6; row5 col2,6; row6 col2,6; row7 col2,6; row8 col2-6. So border is all 1's. Good.\n\nThus output border should be all 1's.\n\nNow, we need to check if the interior mapping we computed uses the correct mapping pairs: We found pairs: (2,3) at row1 col8-9; (4,8) at row7 col9-10; (6,7) at row10 col7-8. Let's verify:\n\n- Row1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0\" -> col8=2, col9=3. So pair (2,3). Good.\n\n- Row7: \"0 0 1 1 7 1 1 0 0 4 8 0 0\" -> col9=4, col10=8. So pair (4,8). Good.\n\n- Row10: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 0 0 0 0\" -> col7=6, col8=7. So pair (6,7). Good.\n\nThus mapping: 3->2, 8->4, 7->6. Good.\n\nNow, we need to double-check if there are any other pairs outside ring that we might have missed: e.g., (2,3) appears at row1. (4,8) at row7. (6,7) at row10. Are there any other non-1 colors outside ring? Let's check entire input for non-1 colors outside ring: \n- Row1: 2,3\n- Row7: 4,8\n- Row10: 6,7\n- Row3: 3 at col4 is inside ring, not outside ring. \n- Row4: 3 at col3,4,5 inside ring.\n- Row5: 8 at col3-5 inside ring.\n- Row6: 7 at col3-5 inside ring.\n- Row7: 7 at col4 inside ring.\n- Row8: no non-1.\n- Row9: none.\n- Row10: 6,7 outside ring.\n- Row11,12: none.\n\nSo only these three pairs. Good.\n\nNow, we need to check if the mapping rule might also involve mapping of interior 1's to something else? But interior 1's are ring color, so we keep them unchanged. In Example 4, interior 1's were kept unchanged. So consistent.\n\nNow, we need to check if the mapping rule might also involve mapping of interior 3's to 2. We did that.\n\nNow, we need to check if there is any interior 2? None.\n\nThus final output is correct.\n\nNow, we need to produce final answer in the required format: just the output grid, with each row on a new line, numbers separated by spaces. So:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 2 2 1\n1 4 4 4 1\n1 6 6 6 1\n1 1 6 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nBut we need to double-check if output row4 interior is 1,6,1. Yes. So row4: 1 1 6 1 1. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if there might be any other ring in test input that we might have missed, e.g., a ring of 2's or 3's or 4's. But there is only one cluster of 2's and 3's at row1 col8-9. That cluster is a pair, not a ring. So no ring. So the only ring is of 1's.\n\nThus final output is as above.\n\nBut let's double-check the mapping rule again: In all examples, the mapping pairs are horizontal pairs outside ring. But we need to confirm that the mapping pairs in test input are indeed horizontal pairs. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to confirm that the ring border is uniform. Yes, all border cells are 1's. Good.\n\nThus we can produce final answer.\n\nHowever, we need to consider if there is any nuance about the ring border: In Example 1, ring border had 8's, but there was a 3 at (3,4) inside ring. In Example 1, the ring border had 8's at all positions, including top row of ring (row6 col4-9). But inside ring, there was 3 at row9 col5. But that 3 is interior. So ring border is uniform 8's. Good.\n\nIn test input, ring border is uniform 1's at positions we identified. So mapping rule holds.\n\nThus final answer is correct.\n\nNow, let's produce the final answer.\n\nBut before we finalize, let's double-check the interior mapping again for any possible mistakes. Let's recalc interior mapping for each interior cell:\n\nInput interior region (rows4-7, cols3-5):\n- Row4: 3,3,3\n- Row5: 8,8,8\n- Row6: 7,7,7\n- Row7: 1,7,1\n\nMapping pairs: (2,3) -> 3->2, (4,8) -> 8->4, (6,7) -> 7->6. So interior mapping:\n\n- Row4: 3->2, 3->2, 3->2 => 2,2,2\n- Row5: 8->4, 8->4, 8->4 => 4,4,4\n- Row6: 7->6, 7->6, 7->6 => 6,6,6\n- Row7: 1 stays 1, 7->6, 1 stays 1 => 1,6,1\n\nThus interior mapping correct.\n\nNow, we need to produce output border: 1's at all border positions. So final output:\n\nRow0: 1 1 1 1 1\nRow1: 1 2 2 2 1\nRow2: 1 4 4 4 1\nRow3: 1 6 6 6 1\nRow4: 1 1 6 1 1\nRow5: 1 1 1 1 1\n\nDouble-check row4: 1 1 6 1 1. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to double-check if the output grid should include the outer border of ring plus interior mapping. Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if the output grid might be 6x5 or 6x5? Yes.\n\nNow, we need to check if there is any requirement to output the grid as a list of rows with spaces. Yes.\n\nThus final answer is as above.\n\nBut let's consider if the mapping might also involve mapping interior 1's to something else if they appear as B in pair. But interior 1's are ring color, but in test input, interior 1's appear at row7 col3 and col5. They are ring color. They remain unchanged. That matches examples.\n\nNow, we need to check if the mapping might also involve mapping interior 1's to something else if they appear as B in pair. But interior 1's are ring color, so mapping rule might not apply. In Example 4, interior 1's remained unchanged. So consistent.\n\nNow, we need to check if the mapping might also involve mapping interior 1's to something else if they appear as B in pair. But no.\n\nThus final answer is correct.\n\nNow, let's consider if the mapping might also involve mapping interior 1's to something else if they appear as A in pair. But interior 1's appear as left side of pair (2,1) in Example 2? Wait, in Example 2, interior 1 appears as left side of pair (2,1). But interior 1 was not inside ring? Wait, interior 1 appears at (4,10) outside ring. That is outside ring. So interior 1 is not inside ring. So mapping rule does not apply. So interior 1 remains unchanged. Good.\n\nThus final answer is correct.\n\nNow, we need to double-check if the output grid is indeed 6x5. But we need to check if the ring border includes all 1's at positions: row3 col2,3,5,6; row4 col2,6; row5 col2,6; row6 col2,6; row7 col2,6; row8 col2-6. That shape encloses interior region rows4-7, cols3-5. So output grid is 6 rows x 5 columns. Good.\n\nNow, we need to check if the output grid matches the pattern of examples: In Example 1, output border was all 8's. In Example 2, border all 3's. In Example 3, border all 8's. In Example 4, border all 1's. So border is ring color. In test input, ring color is 1. So border all 1's. Good.\n\nNow, we need to check if the output grid should be printed as numbers separated by spaces. Yes.\n\nThus final answer is as above.\n\nBut before finalizing, let's consider if there might be any nuance about the mapping: In all examples, the mapping pairs were horizontal pairs with left neighbor mapping to right neighbor. But is that always the case? Let's examine the pairs:\n\nExample 1: (2,3) at row1 col1-2, (1,4) at row3 col1-2. So pairs: (2,3), (1,4). So mapping: 3->2, 4->1. Good.\n\nExample 2: pairs: (6,8) at row2 col5-6, (2,1) at row4 col9-10, (4,5) at row6 col9-10. So mapping: 8->6, 1->2, 5->4. Good.\n\nExample 3: pairs: (1,4) at row7 col1-2, (3,2) at row9 col7-8. So mapping: 4->1, 2->3. Good.\n\nExample 4: pairs: (2,4) at row1 col6-7, (3,8) at row9 col7-8. So mapping: 4->2, 8->3. Good.\n\nSo mapping rule: For each horizontal pair (A,B), map B->A. Good.\n\nNow, we need to confirm that there is no vertical pair or other orientation. But all pairs are horizontal.\n\nThus, mapping rule is consistent.\n\nNow, we need to confirm that we didn't mis-interpret the ring. But ring is the largest rectangle of a single color that encloses interior region. In test input, ring is rectangle of 1's bounding box rows3-8, cols2-6. Good.\n\nThus, final answer is correct.\n\nNow, we need to produce final answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>1 1 1 1 1\n1 2 2 2 1\n1 4 4 4 1\n1 6 6 6 1\n1 1 6 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1<|return|>",

Output also 14x10.\n\nObservations: In input, there are multiple clusters of 3's forming plus-shaped patterns? Let's inspect input of Example 1:\n\nRow indices 0-based? Let's list coordinates of 3's.\n\nInput 1:\n\nRow0: all 0.\nRow1: 3 at column2? Actually row1: \"0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at col2.\nRow2: \"0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at col1,2,3.\nRow3: \"0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at col2.\nRow4: all 0.\nRow5: all 0.\nRow6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\" => 3 at col7.\nRow7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\" => 3 at col6,7,8.\nRow8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\" => 3 at col7.\nRow9: all 0.\nRow10: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at col3.\nRow11: \"0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at col2,3,4.\nRow12: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at col3.\nRow13: all 0.\n\nSo there are 3 clusters of plus shapes: first cluster top-left: coordinates (1,2),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2). That's a plus shape of size 5 (cross). Another cluster top-right: coordinates (6,7),(7,6),(7,7),(7,8),(8,7). Another cluster bottom-left: coordinates (10,3),(11,2),(11,3),(11,4),(12,3). So basically three identical cross shapes.\n\nNow the output: We see same plus shapes but with some 2's added around them? Let's analyze output.\n\nOutput 1 grid:\n\nRow0: all 0.\nRow1: same as input: 3 at col2.\nRow2: same: 3 at col1,2,3.\nRow3: \"0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at col2; 2 at col3? Wait row3: \"0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\" so 2 at col3. That is to the right of the center? The center of cross is at (2,2). The plus shape had arms up/down/left/right at (1,2),(3,2),(2,1),(2,3). In output, the center remains 3? Actually center at (2,2) remains 3. Additional 2 at (3,3). That is diagonally down-right from center. But there is no 2 at other diagonals? Let's check further.\n\nRow4: \"0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\" => 2 at (4,4). That's diagonal down-right from center? Wait center at (2,2). Diagonal down-right would be (3,3). Already placed. Next down-right step would be (4,4). So maybe 2's are placed along diagonal extending from the center to bottom-right? Let's check more.\n\nRow5: \"0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\" => 2 at (5,5). Continue diagonal.\n\nRow6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0\" => 2 at (6,6). Wait there is also 3 at (6,7). So 2 at (6,6) is one step diagonal from center? Actually center at (2,2). Diagonal path: (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6),(7,7),(8,8),(9,9),(10,10),(11,11),(12,12),(13,13)... But grid only 10 columns. So we see 2 at (6,6) which is on that diagonal. Then at (7,7) there is 3 (center of second cross). So the 2's are placed along the diagonal connecting centers of crosses? Let's examine.\n\nRow7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\" => 3's at (7,6),(7,7),(7,8). So center of second cross at (7,7). There's 2 at (6,6) just above-left of that center. Then row8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0\" => 2 at (8,6)? Wait row8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0\" => 2 at (8,6) and 3 at (8,7). Actually 3 at (8,7). So 2 at (8,6) is left of center? Wait center of second cross is at (7,7). The 2's around? Let's analyze systematically.\n\nWe need to examine the pattern of 2's added. In output, 2's appear along a diagonal from the top-left cross to the bottom-left cross? Let's check coordinates of 2's:\n\nRow3 col3\nRow4 col4\nRow5 col5\nRow6 col6\nRow8 col6\nRow9 col5? Wait row9: \"0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\" => 2 at (9,5). Row10: \"0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0\" => 2 at (10,4). Row11: center remains 3 at (11,3),(11,2),(11,4). Row12: no 2? Wait row12: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => no 2. Row13: all 0.\n\nLet's list all 2's:\n\n(3,3)\n(4,4)\n(5,5)\n(6,6)\n(8,6)\n(9,5)\n(10,4)\n\nAlso maybe (7,?) Wait row7 had no 2. Row7 had 3's only. Row8 had 2 at (8,6). Row9 had 2 at (9,5). Row10 had 2 at (10,4). So the 2's form a diagonal line from (3,3) to (10,4) but with a break at (7,7) center? Actually the line goes: (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6),(7,7?) but (7,7) is 3 (center of second cross). Then after center, the line continues at (8,6),(9,5),(10,4). So it's like a diagonal that passes through the center of the second cross but continues on the other side, but due to the cross shape, the 2's are displaced? Wait at (8,6) is left of center, not along the same diagonal. Let's analyze the diagonal direction: Starting from (3,3) to (6,6) is moving down-right. After center at (7,7) (3), we expect next down-right would be (8,8). But instead we see 2 at (8,6) which is down-left from center? Actually from (7,7) to (8,6) is down-left. So maybe the 2's are along a diagonal that goes from top-left cross to bottom-left cross via the center of the middle cross? Wait we need to think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: For each cross shape, place a 2 at the cell that is diagonally adjacent to the center of the cross, along the line connecting the centers of the crosses. Let's compute centers: first cross center at (2,2). second cross center at (7,7). third cross center at (11,3). So centers are at (2,2),(7,7),(11,3). Connect them? The line from (2,2) to (7,7) is diagonal down-right. The line from (7,7) to (11,3) is diagonal down-left? Actually from (7,7) to (11,3) vector (4,-4). So it's diagonal down-left. So we have two diagonal lines crossing at (7,7). The 2's maybe fill the entire diagonal lines between centers. Let's test: The line from (2,2) to (7,7) includes points: (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6),(7,7). But at (7,7) we have center 3, not 2. So 2's at (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6). Good. The line from (7,7) to (11,3) includes points: (8,6),(9,5),(10,4),(11,3). At (11,3) we have center 3. So 2's at (8,6),(9,5),(10,4). That matches output. So the rule: Place 2's along the straight lines connecting the centers of the crosses, but exclude the center points (which remain 3). So 2's fill the line between centers except the center cells.\n\nAlso there might be 2's at (??). Are there any 2's at (??). Let's confirm all 2's: We saw 7 2's. That matches the number of intermediate cells along the two lines: from (2,2) to (7,7) there are 4 intermediate cells (excluding endpoints). From (7,7) to (11,3) there are 3 intermediate cells. So total 7 2's. Yes.\n\nSo rule: For each cluster of 3's that forms a plus shape (center and four arms), we need to connect the centers of these clusters with straight lines (likely Manhattan or diagonal?). The lines are diagonal lines because the centers are at (2,2),(7,7),(11,3). They are connected by diagonals: (2,2)->(7,7) and (7,7)->(11,3). So we need to fill the line between them with color 2. But maybe there is also rule that only if the line is at 45-degree angle? Let's examine Example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input: 14x16? Actually 14 rows, 16 columns. Let's analyze.\n\nInput 2: There are clusters of 3's again. Let's map them.\n\nRows:\n\nRow0: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (0,3)\nRow1: \"0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,10)\nRow2: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (2,3),(2,9),(2,10),(2,11)\nRow3: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (3,10)\nRow4: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (4,7)\nRow5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (5,6),(5,7),(5,8)\nRow6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (6,7)\nRow7: all zeros\nRow8: all zeros\nRow9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (9,10)\nRow10: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (10,9),(10,10),(10,11)\nRow11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (11,10)\nRow12: all zeros\nRow13: all zeros\n\nSo there are three plus shapes? Let's examine: First cluster near top-left: coordinates (0,3),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3). That's a plus shape centered at (1,3). Indeed center at (1,3) with arms up at (0,3), down at (2,3), left at (1,2), right at (1,4). Good.\n\nSecond cluster near top-right: coordinates (1,10),(2,9),(2,10),(2,11),(3,10). That's a plus shape centered at (2,10). Good.\n\nThird cluster near bottom-right: coordinates (9,10),(10,9),(10,10),(10,11),(11,10). That's a plus shape centered at (10,10). Good.\n\nSo three plus shapes again. Now output 2: Let's examine.\n\nOutput 2 grid:\n\nRow0: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => same as input for that cell.\nRow1: \"0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => same as input for that cluster.\nRow2: \"0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\" => at (2,4) there is 2? Wait row2: \"0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\". So at (2,4) we have 2. That is diagonal down-right from center of first cross? Let's see: center of first cross is at (1,3). Diagonal down-right from (1,3) is (2,4). Indeed we have 2 at (2,4). So that matches line from (1,3) to (2,10)? Wait the line from (1,3) to (2,10) is not diagonal; it's not 45 degrees. But maybe the line is from (1,3) to (2,10) along some path? Let's examine.\n\nRow3: \"0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => at (3,5) we have 2, at (3,9) we have 2. So there are 2's at (3,5) and (3,9). Let's analyze.\n\nRow4: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 2 at (4,6) and (4,8). Row5: unchanged. Row6: unchanged. Row7: unchanged. Row8: unchanged. Row9: unchanged. Row10: unchanged. Row11: unchanged. Row12-13: unchanged.\n\nSo 2's appear along two lines: from first cross center (1,3) to second cross center (2,10)? Wait let's compute coordinates: center1 (1,3), center2 (2,10). The line connecting them: slope (10-3)/(2-1)=7/1=7, steep. But we see 2's at (2,4),(3,5),(4,6),(5,7),(6,8),(7,9),(8,10)? But there are 2's at (2,4),(3,5),(4,6),(4,8),(3,9). Wait we see 2 at (3,9),(4,8),(4,6),(3,5),(2,4). That seems to be two lines: one from (1,3) to (2,10) along slope 7? Let's check coordinates: line from (1,3) to (2,10) would pass through points with x increasing by 1 each step? Actually difference is (1,7). So slope 7. So line would go (1,3) -> (2,10). That's just a single step, no intermediate points. So maybe the 2's are not connecting centers directly. Instead, they might be connecting centers with a straight line that goes through intermediate cells in a particular pattern: maybe along the line that goes through the center of the second cross? Wait we see 2's at (3,5),(4,6),(4,8),(3,9). That seems like two lines: one from (1,3) to (4,6) maybe? Let's analyze.\n\nLet's compute center coordinates:\n\ncenter1 = (1,3)\ncenter2 = (2,10)\ncenter3 = (10,10)\n\nBut maybe the second cluster is at (2,10) center. The line from center1 to center2 is almost horizontal but 7 columns difference. The line from center2 to center3 is vertical difference 8 rows, 0 columns difference? Wait center3 at (10,10). So center2 to center3 vertical line: (2,10) to (10,10). So line is vertical. But we see 2's at (3,9),(4,8),(4,6),(3,5),(2,4). That seems to be a diagonal line from center1 to some point near center3? Let's compute.\n\nActually maybe the rule: For each plus shape, we draw a line of 2's connecting the outermost arms of each plus shape? But let's analyze more.\n\nIn Example 2 output, we see 2's forming a diagonal line from (2,4) to (3,5) to (4,6) to (5,7?) Wait we don't see 5,7. Let's check row5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" -> no 2's at row5. So no 5,7. So the line stops at (4,6). Then we see 2's at (4,8),(3,9). That is a diagonal line going up-left? Let's analyze.\n\nMaybe there are two lines: one connecting center1 to center2 along diagonal, and one connecting center2 to center3 along diagonal? Let's compute.\n\nFrom center1 (1,3) to center2 (2,10) difference (1,7). That's not diagonal. But we might be connecting center1 to center3? difference (9,7). That's slope 7/9? Not diagonal.\n\nWait maybe the rule: For each cluster, we find the center, then we find the nearest other cluster center that is not aligned horizontally or vertically? But no.\n\nLet's examine the output more carefully. We'll list all 2 coordinates:\n\nFrom output 2:\n\nRow2: 2 at col4 (index 4).\nRow3: 2 at col5 and col9.\nRow4: 2 at col6 and col8.\n\nThat's all 2's. So 2's coordinates: (2,4),(3,5),(3,9),(4,6),(4,8).\n\nWait there are 5 2's. Let's double-check if there are any 2's elsewhere: Row0-1: no 2. Row2: yes. Row3: yes. Row4: yes. Row5-13: no 2. So exactly 5 2's.\n\nNow, we have 3 cross shapes. Let's compute centers: center1 (1,3), center2 (2,10), center3 (10,10). Now, the 2's appear to form two diagonals: one from (2,4) to (4,6) (down-right). That's 3 cells: (2,4),(3,5),(4,6). That is a diagonal line from (2,4) to (4,6). But why start at (2,4)? That is one step down-right from center1? Actually center1 at (1,3). Down-right from center1 is (2,4). So that is the first cell after center1 along diagonal down-right. Then continues to (3,5),(4,6). That line stops at (4,6). But why stops? Possibly because at (5,7) there is a 3? Wait at (5,7) there is 3 in cluster 2? Actually cluster 2 has 3 at (5,6),(5,7),(5,8). So at (5,7) is 3. So maybe the line stops before hitting a 3. So we fill diagonal from center1 until we hit a 3. That would be at (5,7) but we stop before that, because we don't want to overwrite 3. But we stop at (4,6) which is one cell before (5,7). So that seems plausible.\n\nSimilarly, we see 2's at (4,8),(3,9). That's a diagonal line from (4,8) up-left to (3,9). But why start at (4,8)? That's one step up-left from center2? Actually center2 at (2,10). Up-left from center2 would be (1,9). But we don't have 2 at (1,9). But maybe we start at (3,9) which is one step down-left from center2? Let's analyze.\n\nFrom center2 (2,10), down-left would be (3,9). Yes we have 2 at (3,9). Then next down-left would be (4,8). Yes we have 2 at (4,8). Next would be (5,7) which is 3. So we stop before that. So indeed we are drawing a diagonal line from center2 down-left until we hit a 3. That yields 2's at (3,9),(4,8). But we also have 2 at (2,4),(3,5),(4,6) from center1 down-right until we hit a 3 at (5,7). So indeed the rule might be: For each cross shape, draw a diagonal line of 2's from its center to the nearest other cross shape's center? But no, we are drawing from each center to the nearest 3 that is part of another cluster? Actually we are drawing diagonally until we hit a 3 from any cluster. That seems plausible.\n\nLet's test with Example 1: For each cross shape center, we draw a diagonal line of 2's from center to next cluster? Let's analyze.\n\nIn Example 1, center1 at (2,2). We draw a diagonal line down-right until we hit a 3. The next 3 encountered along that line is at (6,6)? Wait line down-right from (2,2): (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6),(7,7),(8,8),(9,9),(10,10),(11,11),(12,12),(13,13). Among these, there are 3's at (6,6)? Actually there is a 3 at (6,7) and (7,6),(7,7),(7,8),(8,7). Wait (6,6) is 0. (7,7) is 3 (center of second cross). So the first 3 encountered along the diagonal down-right is at (7,7). So we draw 2's from (3,3) to (6,6) (excluding center and excluding the 3 at (7,7)). That matches output: 2 at (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6). Good.\n\nSimilarly, from center2 at (7,7), we draw a diagonal line down-left until we hit a 3. Down-left from (7,7): (8,6),(9,5),(10,4),(11,3),(12,2),(13,1),(14,0). Among these, there is a 3 at (10,4)? Wait (10,4) is 0? Actually at (10,4) we have 0. Wait we have 3 at (10,3) and (11,3),(11,2),(11,4). But (10,4) is 0. (11,3) is 3. So first 3 encountered is at (11,3). So we draw 2's from (8,6),(9,5),(10,4) until before (11,3). That matches output: 2 at (8,6),(9,5),(10,4). Good.\n\nFrom center3 at (11,3), we might also draw a diagonal line? But there is no other 3 along diagonal up-left or up-right? Let's check. Up-right from (11,3): (10,4),(9,5),(8,6),(7,7),(6,8),(5,9),(4,10),(3,11),(2,12),(1,13),(0,14). But there is 3 at (7,7) along that path. But we might have drawn that earlier from center2 down-left. But the rule might be to draw lines only in one direction? In Example 1, we drew from center1 down-right, and from center2 down-left. But we didn't draw from center3 because maybe we only draw from each cluster to the next cluster in some order. But we might also draw from center3 up-left? Let's examine: Up-left from (11,3): (10,2),(9,1),(8,0),(7,-1) out-of-bounds. None of those are 3. So no line. Up-right from (11,3) goes to (10,4),(9,5),(8,6),(7,7) etc. The first 3 encountered is at (7,7). But we might have already drawn line from center2 down-left. But maybe the rule is: For each cluster, draw a diagonal line of 2's from its center to the nearest other cluster's center, but only in one direction: from the cluster with smaller row index to larger row index? Or maybe we only draw lines that go from the cluster with smaller row to cluster with larger row? Let's check Example 1: cluster1 at row 2, cluster2 at row 7, cluster3 at row 11. We drew lines from cluster1 to cluster2 (down-right). And from cluster2 to cluster3 (down-left). That fits: cluster1 to cluster2 (row increases). cluster2 to cluster3 (row increases). So we always draw from a cluster to the next cluster in row order. That might be the rule: connect consecutive clusters in vertical order with diagonal lines.\n\nIn Example 2: Let's check cluster row indices: cluster1 at row1 (center at (1,3)), cluster2 at row2 (center at (2,10)), cluster3 at row10 (center at (10,10)). So cluster1 to cluster2: row increases by 1. We would draw a line from cluster1 to cluster2. But the line between center1 (1,3) and center2 (2,10) is not diagonal; but we still drew a diagonal line from center1 down-right until hitting a 3 from cluster2? Let's see. The nearest 3 from cluster2 along diagonal down-right from center1? Actually center1 to center2 is not diagonal, but we might draw from center1 to cluster2's nearest 3 along diagonal. Let's analyze.\n\nFrom center1 (1,3), we draw a diagonal line down-right until we hit a 3. The first 3 encountered along that diagonal is at (2,4)? Wait we need to check. The diagonal down-right from center1: (2,4),(3,5),(4,6),(5,7),(6,8),(7,9),(8,10),(9,11),(10,12),(11,13),(12,14),(13,15). Among these, there is a 3 at (2,4)? Actually (2,4) is 0. (3,5) is 0. (4,6) is 0. (5,7) is 3 (center2 cluster). Wait cluster2 has 3's at (5,6),(5,7),(5,8). So (5,7) is 3. So the first 3 encountered along that diagonal is at (5,7). So we would draw 2's at (2,4),(3,5),(4,6) until before (5,7). That matches output: 2 at (2,4),(3,5),(4,6). Good.\n\nFrom center2 (2,10), we draw a diagonal line down-left until we hit a 3. The diagonal down-left from center2: (3,9),(4,8),(5,7),(6,6),(7,5),(8,4),(9,3),(10,2),(11,1),(12,0). Among these, the first 3 encountered is at (5,7) (center2 cluster). Actually (5,7) is part of cluster2 itself. But we are starting from center2, so the first 3 encountered is at (5,7) which is part of the same cluster. But we might consider that we should ignore the same cluster? But we start from center2 and we might skip over cells that are part of the same cluster? Actually we might consider that we start drawing from center2 to the next cluster (cluster3). But the first 3 encountered along the diagonal down-left from center2 is at (5,7) which is part of cluster2 itself, not cluster3. So we might need to skip over the cluster's own arms? Let's examine: The cluster2 arms are at (5,6),(5,7),(5,8). So along diagonal down-left from center2, we would first hit (5,7) which is part of cluster2. We might need to skip over that and continue until we hit a 3 from another cluster. So after skipping (5,7), we next hit (6,6) which is 0. (7,5) 0, (8,4) 0, (9,3) 0, (10,2) 0, (11,1) 0, (12,0) 0. None of these are 3. So we would not stop? But we see 2's at (3,9),(4,8). Wait those are on the diagonal up-left from center2? Actually from center2 (2,10), up-left diagonal: (1,9),(0,8),(-1,7). That path includes (1,9) which is 0, (0,8) 0. So no 3. So we wouldn't draw anything. But we see 2's at (3,9),(4,8). That's down-left from center2, not up-left. But we didn't draw them because we would stop at (5,7). But we actually did draw them because we didn't stop at (5,7)? Wait we need to re-evaluate.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For each cluster, draw a diagonal line of 2's from its center to the nearest 3 from any other cluster, but only if that 3 is not part of the same cluster. But in this case, the nearest 3 along diagonal down-left from center2 is at (5,7) which is part of the same cluster. So we need to find the next 3 after that along the same diagonal, which might be at (??). Let's check: After (5,7), next down-left is (6,6),(7,5),(8,4),(9,3),(10,2),(11,1),(12,0). Are any of these 3? No. So there is no 3 on that diagonal beyond cluster2. So we wouldn't draw any 2's along that diagonal. But we see 2's at (3,9),(4,8) which are along diagonal down-left from center2? Wait let's compute coordinates: center2 at (2,10). Down-left from center2: (3,9),(4,8),(5,7),(6,6),(7,5),(8,4),(9,3),(10,2),(11,1),(12,0). So (3,9) is the first cell after center2. (4,8) second. (5,7) third. So the 2's at (3,9),(4,8) are indeed along this diagonal. They stop before (5,7) which is part of cluster2. So they are placed until just before the next cluster's arm? But we didn't skip over the cluster's own arms; we stop before hitting any 3, including those from same cluster? Wait we stop before hitting any 3, regardless of cluster membership. So we stop at (4,8) because the next cell (5,7) is a 3. So we don't place 2 at (5,7) because it's 3. So we placed 2's at (3,9),(4,8). That matches output.\n\nSo the rule: For each cluster, we consider the 4 diagonal directions? Actually we considered only down-right for cluster1, down-left for cluster2. But why not consider up-left or up-right? Maybe because we only consider directions that lead towards other clusters? But we can also consider that we always draw a line from each cluster to the next cluster in some order, but the direction is determined by the relative positions of the clusters. For cluster1 to cluster2, the line is down-right because cluster2 is to the down-right relative to cluster1. For cluster2 to cluster3, cluster3 is down-left relative to cluster2. So we draw line accordingly. That matches. In Example 1, cluster1 to cluster2: cluster2 is down-right relative to cluster1. cluster2 to cluster3: cluster3 is down-left relative to cluster2. So we draw lines accordingly.\n\nThus the rule: For each pair of clusters sorted by their center row (or maybe by row and column), we draw a diagonal line of 2's from the first cluster's center to the second cluster's center, stopping before the second cluster's center. But we might also consider that we skip over any cells that contain 3 (from any cluster). But the line might be obstructed by other 3's? In Example 1, the line from cluster1 to cluster2 passes through (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6),(7,7). But we stop before (7,7) because it's a 3. So we fill until before the 3. That matches. In Example 2, the line from cluster1 to cluster2 passes through (2,4),(3,5),(4,6),(5,7),(6,8),(7,9),(8,10),(9,11),(10,12),(11,13),(12,14),(13,15). The first 3 encountered is at (5,7). So we stop before (5,7). So we fill (2,4),(3,5),(4,6). Good.\n\nFrom cluster2 to cluster3: cluster2 center at (2,10), cluster3 center at (10,10). The line between them is vertical downwards. But we are not drawing vertical lines; we draw diagonal lines only. But we might need to consider that we should draw a diagonal line connecting cluster2 to cluster3. But cluster3 is directly below cluster2 (same column). The diagonal that goes from cluster2 to cluster3 would be either down-left or down-right. Which one? There are two diagonals that pass through cluster3? Let's check: Starting from cluster2 at (2,10), down-right diagonal: (3,11),(4,12),(5,13),(6,14),(7,15),(8,16) out-of-bounds. None of these are 3. So we wouldn't draw anything. Down-left diagonal: (3,9),(4,8),(5,7),(6,6),(7,5),(8,4),(9,3),(10,2),(11,1),(12,0). The first 3 encountered is at (5,7) (cluster2). So we stop before that. So we fill (3,9),(4,8). So we did draw along down-left. So we considered down-left because cluster3 is to the down-left direction? But cluster3 is directly below cluster2, not down-left. However, the line down-left from cluster2 passes through cluster3? Let's see: cluster3 center at (10,10). Is that on the down-left diagonal from cluster2? Let's check: Starting from (2,10), down-left: (3,9),(4,8),(5,7),(6,6),(7,5),(8,4),(9,3),(10,2),(11,1),(12,0). So cluster3 center at (10,10) is not on that diagonal. So the line from cluster2 to cluster3 does not pass through cluster3's center. So why would we draw a line? But we did draw a line from cluster2 to cluster3? Actually we drew a line from cluster2 to cluster3? Let's check: cluster2 center (2,10). cluster3 center (10,10). The line connecting them is vertical. But we didn't draw a vertical line. Instead we drew a diagonal line from cluster2 to some other point? But we didn't draw a line from cluster2 to cluster3. But we did draw a line from cluster2 to cluster2's own arms? Wait we drew 2's at (3,9),(4,8) which are along diagonal down-left from cluster2. Those cells are not part of cluster3. So we didn't draw a line to cluster3. So maybe the rule is not to connect clusters; it's to draw diagonal lines from each cluster's center outward until hitting any 3, regardless of cluster membership. That would produce the 2's we saw.\n\nLet's test this rule on Example 1: For each cluster center, draw diagonal lines outward in all four diagonal directions until hitting a 3. But we only saw 2's in two directions: from center1 down-right, from center2 down-left. But why not up-left or up-right? Because there might be no 3 in those directions. Let's test.\n\nFor center1 (2,2), diagonals:\n\n- Up-left: (1,1),(0,0). None of those are 3. So we might keep going until out-of-bounds. But we didn't place 2's there. So maybe we only consider diagonals that eventually hit a 3? But we could keep going until out-of-bounds; but we didn't. So maybe we only consider diagonals that eventually hit a 3? But we didn't place 2's for up-left because there is no 3 in that direction. So rule: For each cluster center, find the nearest 3 along each of the 4 diagonal directions. If such a 3 exists, fill the intermediate cells along that diagonal with 2's. That seems plausible.\n\nLet's test on center1: Diagonal up-left: no 3. Diagonal up-right: (1,3),(0,4). (1,3) is 0? Actually row1 col3? Input row1 col3 is 0. So no 3. So no 2's. Diagonal down-left: (3,1),(4,0). (3,1) is 0. So no 3. Diagonal down-right: (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6),(7,7),(8,8),(9,9),(10,10),(11,11),(12,12),(13,13). The first 3 encountered is at (7,7). So we fill (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6). That matches.\n\nNow center2 (7,7):\n\n- Up-left: (6,6),(5,5),(4,4),(3,3),(2,2),(1,1),(0,0). The first 3 encountered? (6,6) is 0, (5,5) 0, (4,4) 0, (3,3) 0, (2,2) is 3 (center1). So we would fill (6,6),(5,5),(4,4),(3,3) until before (2,2). But we already have 2's at (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6) from center1's line. But maybe we don't add duplicates. But we might also fill them again? But we already have them. So no new 2's. But we didn't see any new 2's for up-left. But we might have duplicates.\n\n- Up-right: (6,8),(5,9),(4,10),(3,11),(2,12),(1,13),(0,14). Are any of these 3? (6,8) 0, (5,9) 0, (4,10) 0, (3,11) 0, (2,12) 0, (1,13) 0, (0,14) 0. So no 3. So no 2's.\n\n- Down-left: (8,6),(9,5),(10,4),(11,3),(12,2),(13,1),(14,0). The first 3 encountered is at (11,3). So we fill (8,6),(9,5),(10,4). That matches output.\n\n- Down-right: (8,8),(9,9),(10,10),(11,11),(12,12),(13,13). None of these are 3. So no 2's.\n\nThus the rule of drawing diagonal lines from each center to the nearest 3 in each diagonal direction matches all 2's in Example 1.\n\nNow let's test on Example 2:\n\nCenter1 (1,3):\n\n- Up-left: (0,2). That's 0. So no 3. No 2's.\n\n- Up-right: (0,4). 0. So no 2's.\n\n- Down-left: (2,2),(3,1),(4,0). (2,2) is 0. So no 3. So no 2's.\n\n- Down-right: (2,4),(3,5),(4,6),(5,7),(6,8),(7,9),(8,10),(9,11),(10,12),(11,13),(12,14),(13,15). We need to find the first 3. Let's check each:\n\n(2,4) 0\n(3,5) 0\n(4,6) 0\n(5,7) 3 (center2 cluster). So first 3 is at (5,7). So we fill (2,4),(3,5),(4,6). That matches output.\n\nCenter2 (2,10):\n\n- Up-left: (1,9),(0,8). (1,9) 0, (0,8) 0. No 3.\n\n- Up-right: (1,11),(0,12). (1,11) 0, (0,12) 0. No 3.\n\n- Down-left: (3,9),(4,8),(5,7),(6,6),(7,5),(8,4),(9,3),(10,2),(11,1),(12,0). Let's check for 3:\n\n(3,9) 0\n(4,8) 0\n(5,7) 3 (center2 cluster). So first 3 is at (5,7). So we fill (3,9),(4,8). That matches output.\n\n- Down-right: (3,11),(4,12),(5,13),(6,14),(7,15). None 3.\n\nThus 2's from center2 are (3,9),(4,8). Good.\n\nCenter3 (10,10):\n\n- Up-left: (9,9),(8,8),(7,7),(6,6),(5,5),(4,4),(3,3),(2,2),(1,1),(0,0). Check for 3:\n\n(9,9) 0\n(8,8) 0\n(7,7) 0\n(6,6) 0\n(5,5) 0\n(4,4) 0\n(3,3) 0\n(2,2) 0\n(1,1) 0\n(0,0) 0. So no 3.\n\n- Up-right: (9,11),(8,12),(7,13),(6,14),(5,15). None 3.\n\n- Down-left: (11,9),(12,8),(13,7),(14,6),(15,5). (11,9) 0, (12,8) 0, (13,7) 0, (14,6) 0, (15,5) 0. No 3.\n\n- Down-right: (11,11),(12,12),(13,13),(14,14),(15,15). (11,11) 0, (12,12) 0, (13,13) 0, (14,14) 0, (15,15) 0. No 3.\n\nThus center3 would not produce any 2's. That matches output: no 2's from cluster3. So rule holds: For each cluster center, look in each of the 4 diagonal directions. If you encounter a 3 at some distance, fill all cells between the center and that 3 (excluding the 3) with 2. That seems to produce the 2's in both examples.\n\nNow let's test on Example 3.\n\nExample 3 Input: 12x13? Let's examine.\n\nInput 3:\n\nRow0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\" => 3 at (0,10).\nRow1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\" => 3 at (1,9),(1,10),(1,11).\nRow2: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0\" => 3 at (2,6),(2,10).\nRow3: \"0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (3,5),(3,6),(3,7).\nRow4: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (4,6).\nRow5: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (5,3).\nRow6: \"0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (6,2),(6,3),(6,4).\nRow7: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\" => 3 at (7,3),(7,10).\nRow8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\" => 3 at (8,9),(8,10),(8,11).\nRow9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\" => 3 at (9,10).\nRow10: all 0.\nRow11: all 0.\n\nSo we have plus shapes? Let's identify clusters:\n\nCluster A: top-right cluster: coordinates (0,10),(1,9),(1,10),(1,11),(2,10). That's a plus shape centered at (1,10). Indeed arms: up (0,10), down (2,10), left (1,9), right (1,11). Good.\n\nCluster B: center at (3,6)? Let's see coordinates: (2,6),(3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(4,6). That's a plus shape centered at (3,6). Good.\n\nCluster C: center at (6,3)? Coordinates: (5,3),(6,2),(6,3),(6,4),(7,3). That's a plus shape centered at (6,3). Good.\n\nCluster D: center at (8,10)? Coordinates: (7,10),(8,9),(8,10),(8,11),(9,10). That's a plus shape centered at (8,10). Good.\n\nSo we have 4 clusters. The output for Example 3 shows 2's at:\n\nRow4: \"0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 2 at (4,5). Wait row4: \"0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So 2 at (4,5). That is left of center B at (3,6)? Actually center B at (3,6). (4,5) is down-left from center B. Let's analyze.\n\nRow5: \"0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 2 at (5,4). That's down-left from center C at (6,3)? Wait center C at (6,3). Down-left from center C would be (7,2). But (5,4) is up-right? Actually from center C at (6,3), up-right is (5,4). So 2 at (5,4) is up-right from center C. So we need to check.\n\nRow6: unchanged.\n\nRow7: unchanged.\n\nRow8: unchanged.\n\nSo we have 2's at (4,5),(5,4). Let's see if there are any other 2's: Row? The output shows only 2's at these two positions. Let's confirm: Output 3 grid:\n\nRow0: same as input.\nRow1: same as input.\nRow2: same as input.\nRow3: same as input.\nRow4: \"0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 2 at (4,5)\nRow5: \"0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 2 at (5,4)\nRow6: unchanged.\nRow7: unchanged.\nRow8: unchanged.\nRow9: unchanged.\nRow10: unchanged.\nRow11: unchanged.\n\nThus there are 2 2's. Let's apply the rule: For each cluster center, look along each diagonal direction until hitting a 3, fill intermediate cells with 2. Let's test for each cluster:\n\nCluster A: center at (1,10). Diagonals:\n\n- Up-left: (0,9) 0? Actually (0,9) is 0. Next (-1,8) out-of-bounds. No 3. So no 2's.\n\n- Up-right: (0,11) 0? (0,11) 0. Next (-1,12) out-of-bounds. No 3.\n\n- Down-left: (2,9) 0? (2,9) 0. Next (3,8) 0? (3,8) 0. Next (4,7) 0? (4,7) 0. Next (5,6) 0? (5,6) 0. Next (6,5) 0? (6,5) 0. Next (7,4) 0? (7,4) 0. Next (8,3) 0? (8,3) 0. Next (9,2) 0? (9,2) 0. Next (10,1) 0? (10,1) 0. Next (11,0) 0? (11,0) 0. No 3. So no 2's.\n\n- Down-right: (2,11) 0? (2,11) 0. Next (3,12) 0? (3,12) 0. Next (4,13) out-of-bounds. No 3.\n\nThus cluster A produces no 2's. That matches output: no 2's from cluster A.\n\nCluster B: center at (3,6). Diagonals:\n\n- Up-left: (2,5) 0? (2,5) 0. Next (1,4) 0? (1,4) 0. Next (0,3) 0? (0,3) 0. Next (-1,2) out-of-bounds. No 3.\n\n- Up-right: (2,7) 0? (2,7) 0. Next (1,8) 0? (1,8) 0. Next (0,9) 0? (0,9) 0. Next (-1,10) out-of-bounds. No 3.\n\n- Down-left: (4,5) 0? Wait (4,5) is 0 in input. Next (5,4) 0? (5,4) 0. Next (6,3) 3 (center C). So first 3 encountered is at (6,3). So we fill (4,5),(5,4). That matches output: 2's at (4,5),(5,4). Good.\n\n- Down-right: (4,7) 0? (4,7) 0. Next (5,8) 0? (5,8) 0. Next (6,9) 0? (6,9) 0. Next (7,10) 3 (center D). So first 3 encountered is at (7,10). So we would fill (4,7),(5,8),(6,9). But output does not contain 2's at these positions. Wait maybe we missed something: Did we check (4,7) etc? But output does not have 2's at (4,7),(5,8),(6,9). So why didn't we fill them? Let's double-check the input: (7,10) is 3 (center D). So yes, the line from center B down-right should hit that 3. According to the rule, we should fill intermediate cells with 2. But output does not show them. So maybe we mis-evaluated: maybe there is a 3 earlier along that diagonal that stops the line before reaching (7,10). Let's check each step:\n\n- (4,7) 0\n- (5,8) 0\n- (6,9) 0\n- (7,10) 3\n\nSo first 3 encountered is indeed (7,10). So we would fill (4,7),(5,8),(6,9). But output didn't show them. So maybe the rule is not to draw diagonal lines from each cluster in all directions, but only in certain directions? Maybe we only draw diagonal lines that connect to another cluster's center? But the line from center B down-right goes to center D at (8,10)? Wait center D is at (8,10). The diagonal from (3,6) down-right passes through (4,7),(5,8),(6,9),(7,10),(8,11),(9,12). The first 3 encountered is at (7,10) which is not a center but part of cluster D. The next 3 is at (8,11) which is part of cluster D. So the line would hit a 3 at (7,10). So we would fill up to (6,9). But output doesn't show that.\n\nMaybe the rule is to only draw lines that connect two cluster centers, not any cluster cells. In that case, we would only draw along diagonals that connect a cluster center to another cluster center. Let's test:\n\n- For cluster B (3,6) to cluster C (6,3) is down-left direction. That line passes through (4,5),(5,4),(6,3). Yes, we fill (4,5),(5,4). Good.\n\n- For cluster B to cluster D (8,10) is down-right direction. The line from (3,6) to (8,10) is slope (5,4). That's not a 45-degree diagonal. But we might consider the diagonal that goes from center B to center D? Let's compute: vector (8-3,10-6) = (5,4). That's not 45 degrees. But we might approximate with a diagonal that goes down-right? But the line from (3,6) to (8,10) is not along a 45-degree line. So maybe we don't draw a line because the line connecting centers is not at 45 degrees. That would explain why no 2's from B to D.\n\n- For cluster B to cluster A (1,10) is up-right direction. Vector (-2,4). Not 45 degrees. So no line.\n\n- For cluster C (6,3) to cluster D (8,10) is down-right direction? Vector (2,7). Not 45 degrees. So no line.\n\n- For cluster C to cluster A (1,10) is up-right: vector (-5,7). Not 45 degrees.\n\n- For cluster C to cluster B (3,6) is up-right: vector (-3,3). That's 45 degrees. Indeed we already considered B to C. So we draw line from C to B? Wait we considered B to C. But we could also consider C to B. That would be up-right direction from C to B. The line from (6,3) to (3,6) goes up-right. The cells between them: (5,4),(4,5). So we fill 2's at (5,4),(4,5). That's the same as we did earlier. So the rule might be: For each pair of clusters, if the line connecting their centers is at 45 degrees (i.e., difference in row equals difference in column), then we fill 2's along that diagonal between them, excluding the centers.\n\nLet's test this rule on Example 1:\n\nClusters: center1 (2,2), center2 (7,7), center3 (11,3).\n\nCheck pairs:\n\n- center1 to center2: vector (5,5). That's 45 degrees. So we fill cells between them: (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6). Good.\n\n- center1 to center3: vector (9,1). Not 45 degrees. So no line.\n\n- center2 to center3: vector (4,-4). That's 45 degrees (abs difference equal). So we fill cells between them: (8,6),(9,5),(10,4). Good.\n\nThus rule holds.\n\nExample 2:\n\nClusters: center1 (1,3), center2 (2,10), center3 (10,10).\n\nCheck pairs:\n\n- center1 to center2: vector (1,7). Not 45 degrees. So no line.\n\n- center1 to center3: vector (9,7). Not 45 degrees.\n\n- center2 to center3: vector (8,0). Not 45 degrees.\n\nWait but we did get 2's from center1 to center2 along diagonal down-right until hitting a 3, but that line is not between centers. So rule fails.\n\nBut we saw 2's from center1 to center2? Wait we had 2's from center1 to center2? Actually we had 2's from center1 to center2's cluster? But not between centers. So rule fails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: For each cluster, we draw a diagonal line of 2's from its center to the nearest 3 that is not part of the same cluster, along any diagonal direction. That is what we initially considered. Let's test on Example 3: For cluster B to cluster D, the nearest 3 along down-right diagonal is at (7,10). But that is part of cluster D. According to rule, we would fill (4,7),(5,8),(6,9). But output didn't show them. So maybe the rule is: We only consider the nearest 3 that is the center of another cluster? But (7,10) is not a center. The center of cluster D is (8,10). But the nearest 3 along down-right from center B is at (7,10) which is not the center. So we might ignore that line. So we only consider lines that go to another cluster's center? But then we wouldn't draw from center B to cluster C either because center C is at (6,3) which is down-left direction. That is a center. We did fill that. So we only draw lines between cluster centers that are at 45-degree angle? But cluster B to cluster C is at 45 degrees. So that line is drawn. So rule: For each pair of cluster centers that are at 45 degrees relative to each other, draw a line of 2's between them, excluding the centers.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1: It matches.\n\nExample 2: Are there any cluster center pairs at 45 degrees? Let's compute:\n\ncenter1 (1,3), center2 (2,10): difference (1,7). Not 45.\n\ncenter1 (1,3), center3 (10,10): difference (9,7). Not 45.\n\ncenter2 (2,10), center3 (10,10): difference (8,0). Not 45.\n\nSo no pairs at 45 degrees. But we still have 2's in output. So rule fails.\n\nThus the rule cannot be simply connecting cluster centers at 45 degrees. There must be a more general rule.\n\nLet's revisit the rule of drawing diagonal lines from each cluster center to the nearest 3 in each diagonal direction. That produced correct output for Example 1 and 2. But it produced extra 2's for Example 3 (down-right from cluster B). So maybe we need to refine: Only draw diagonal lines that go to a 3 that is the center of a cluster? But in Example 3, the nearest 3 along down-right from cluster B is at (7,10) which is part of cluster D but not the center. The center of cluster D is at (8,10). So maybe we should stop at the nearest 3 that is a center of a cluster? But we need to check if that would produce the output.\n\nLet's test: For cluster B (3,6):\n\n- Up-left: no 3.\n\n- Up-right: no 3.\n\n- Down-left: nearest 3 at (6,3) which is center of cluster C. So we fill (4,5),(5,4). Good.\n\n- Down-right: nearest 3 at (7,10) which is not a center. Next 3 after that along same diagonal is at (8,11) which is part of cluster D but not center. Next is (9,12) which is 0. So no center encountered. So we would not fill any 2's. That matches output.\n\nNow cluster C (6,3):\n\n- Up-left: nearest 3 at (3,6) which is center of cluster B. So we fill (5,4),(4,5). But those are already filled by cluster B. But duplicates don't matter. So we might fill again but no new cells.\n\n- Up-right: nearest 3 at (3,6) center of B. So we fill (5,4),(4,5). Already filled.\n\n- Down-left: nearest 3 at (9,0)? Actually down-left from (6,3): (7,2),(8,1),(9,0),(10,-1). None are 3. So no 2's.\n\n- Down-right: nearest 3 at (9,6)? Wait down-right from (6,3): (7,4),(8,5),(9,6),(10,7),(11,8),(12,9),(13,10),(14,11). Are any of these 3? (7,4) 0, (8,5) 0, (9,6) 0, (10,7) 0, (11,8) 0, etc. So no 2's.\n\nThus cluster C would not produce new 2's.\n\nCluster A (1,10):\n\n- Up-left: no 3.\n\n- Up-right: no 3.\n\n- Down-left: nearest 3 at (3,8)? Wait down-left from (1,10): (2,9),(3,8),(4,7),(5,6),(6,5),(7,4),(8,3),(9,2),(10,1),(11,0). Are any of these 3? (2,9) 0, (3,8) 0, (4,7) 0, (5,6) 0, (6,5) 0, (7,4) 0, (8,3) 0, (9,2) 0, (10,1) 0, (11,0) 0. So no 2's.\n\n- Down-right: nearest 3 at (2,11),(3,12),(4,13). None. So no 2's.\n\nCluster D (8,10):\n\n- Up-left: nearest 3 at (6,8)? Wait up-left from (8,10): (7,9),(6,8),(5,7),(4,6),(3,5),(2,4),(1,3),(0,2). Are any of these 3? (7,9) 0, (6,8) 0, (5,7) 0, (4,6) 0, (3,5) 0, (2,4) 0, (1,3) 0, (0,2) 0. So no 2's.\n\n- Up-right: (7,11),(6,12),(5,13),(4,14),(3,15),(2,16),(1,17),(0,18). None 3.\n\n- Down-left: (9,9),(10,8),(11,7),(12,6),(13,5),(14,4),(15,3),(16,2),(17,1),(18,0). None 3.\n\n- Down-right: (9,11),(10,12),(11,13),(12,14),(13,15),(14,16),(15,17),(16,18),(17,19),(18,20). None 3.\n\nThus cluster D produces no 2's. So only cluster B and C produce 2's. But we see only two 2's in output. That matches.\n\nThus the rule of drawing diagonal lines from each cluster center to the nearest 3 in each diagonal direction, but only if that 3 is the center of a cluster? Wait we used the rule \"nearest 3 that is a center of a cluster\" for cluster B down-right? Actually we considered the nearest 3 along down-right from cluster B, and we found the nearest 3 at (7,10) which is not a center. So we didn't fill. That matches output.\n\nBut we also had nearest 3 along down-left from cluster B at (6,3) which is a center. So we fill. For cluster C up-left/up-right, nearest 3 at (3,6) center. So we fill. That produced duplicates but no new cells.\n\nThus the rule: For each cluster center, for each diagonal direction, find the nearest 3 that is a center of another cluster. If such a 3 exists, fill all intermediate cells with 2. That seems to produce correct outputs for all examples.\n\nBut we need to check Example 2: Did we have any center-to-center diagonals? Let's compute cluster centers:\n\ncenter1 (1,3)\ncenter2 (2,10)\ncenter3 (10,10)\n\nNow we need to find for each cluster center, the nearest 3 that is a center of another cluster along each diagonal direction.\n\nLet's examine cluster1 (1,3):\n\n- Down-right: nearest 3 at (5,7)? Wait we need to check if (5,7) is a center of a cluster. cluster2 center is (2,10), cluster3 center is (10,10). So (5,7) is not a center. So we would not fill. But output had 2's from cluster1 down-right. So rule fails. So we cannot restrict to center-of-cluster.\n\nThus rule cannot be that.\n\nSo we need to refine: The rule is to draw diagonal lines from each cluster center to the nearest 3 in each diagonal direction, but we stop at the first 3 encountered, regardless of cluster membership. That produced correct output for Example 1 and 2. But for Example 3, we would have produced extra 2's from cluster B down-right to (7,10). But we didn't because maybe we only consider diagonals that go to a 3 that is part of a cluster but not part of the same cluster? Actually (7,10) is part of cluster D but not the center. So it's part of a cluster. So why didn't we fill? Let's examine: In Example 3, cluster B down-right direction: The first 3 encountered is at (7,10) which is part of cluster D. According to the rule, we should fill intermediate cells until before that 3. That would produce 2's at (4,7),(5,8),(6,9). But output didn't show them. So maybe the rule is that we only draw diagonal lines from a cluster center to the nearest 3 that is part of a cluster, but we skip the 3 that is part of the same cluster? Wait (7,10) is part of cluster D, not same cluster. So we should draw. But we didn't.\n\nThus the rule must differentiate between cluster D's cells that are part of the cluster but not the center. Maybe we only consider the nearest 3 that is a center of a cluster? But we saw that fails for Example 2. So something else.\n\nMaybe the rule is to draw diagonal lines from each cluster center to the nearest 3 that is not part of any cluster? But all 3's are part of clusters. So that fails.\n\nMaybe the rule is to draw diagonal lines from each cluster center to the nearest 3 that is not adjacent (i.e., not part of the cluster arms). But in Example 2, the nearest 3 from center1 down-right is at (5,7) which is part of cluster2's arms. So that would be excluded. But we still drew 2's. So no.\n\nLet's re-examine Example 3 output. Did we misread? Maybe there are more 2's that we missed. Let's re-check the output for Example 3:\n\nOutput 3 grid lines:\n\nRow0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\" => same as input.\nRow1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\" => same as input.\nRow2: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0\" => same as input.\nRow3: \"0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => same as input.\nRow4: \"0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 2 at (4,5). (others unchanged)\nRow5: \"0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 2 at (5,4).\nRow6: \"0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => unchanged.\nRow7: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\" => unchanged.\nRow8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\" => unchanged.\nRow9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\" => unchanged.\nRow10: all zeros.\nRow11: all zeros.\n\nThus only two 2's. So indeed no 2's at (4,7),(5,8),(6,9). So our rule must exclude that line.\n\nLet's analyze the geometry: In Example 3, cluster B at (3,6) and cluster D at (8,10). The line from B to D is not a 45-degree diagonal; it's slope 4/5? Actually vector (5,4). So not 45 degrees. But we still had a diagonal line from B to D's cell at (7,10) which is part of cluster D. But we didn't draw because the line from B to D's cell is not a straight diagonal? Wait the line from B to (7,10) is down-right but with slope 1? Let's check: B at (3,6), (7,10) difference (4,4). Actually (7-3=4,10-6=4). That's a 45-degree diagonal! Wait I miscomputed: (7,10) is at row 7, col 10. B at (3,6). The difference is (4,4). So it's a 45-degree diagonal. So we had a diagonal line from B to (7,10). So we would fill intermediate cells (4,7),(5,8),(6,9). But we didn't. So why not? Let's check if (7,10) is part of cluster D. Yes cluster D is centered at (8,10). The arms of cluster D are at (7,10),(8,9),(8,10),(8,11),(9,10). So (7,10) is part of cluster D but not the center. So the nearest 3 along down-right from B is at (7,10) which is part of cluster D but not center. So we didn't fill. So maybe the rule is: We only draw lines to the nearest 3 that is the center of a cluster, not any 3. But we already saw that fails for Example 2 because we drew lines from center1 to cluster2's arms (which are not center). Wait let's double-check Example 2: Did we draw lines from center1 to cluster2's arms? We did: we drew 2's at (2,4),(3,5),(4,6). The nearest 3 along down-right from center1 is at (5,7) which is part of cluster2's arms, not center. So that would be excluded if we only draw to centers. But we did. So rule fails.\n\nThus we need a more nuanced rule.\n\nLet's analyze Example 2 again to see if there is any difference. Maybe the difference is that cluster2's arms are not the nearest 3 along that diagonal? Wait we found nearest 3 along down-right from center1 is at (5,7). But maybe there is a 3 at (2,4)? Let's check: (2,4) is 0. So the nearest 3 is indeed (5,7). So we drew 2's until before (5,7). That matches rule of drawing until nearest 3, regardless of membership.\n\nSo why didn't we draw line from cluster B to cluster D in Example 3? Because the nearest 3 along down-right from cluster B is at (7,10) which is part of cluster D, but we didn't draw. So something else must be preventing that.\n\nLet's examine cluster B down-right path: (4,7),(5,8),(6,9),(7,10). Are any of these 3's? (4,7) 0, (5,8) 0, (6,9) 0, (7,10) 3. So the nearest 3 is at (7,10). So we would draw 2's at (4,7),(5,8),(6,9). But output didn't. So maybe the rule is that we only draw lines that go to the nearest 3 that is also the center of a cluster or a cell that is directly adjacent to a center? Wait (7,10) is adjacent to center D at (8,10). But maybe we require that the 3 we stop at must be the center itself, not just any 3. But cluster2's arms were also not centers, but we drew lines to them. So why difference? Let's examine cluster1 in Example 2: The nearest 3 along down-right from center1 is at (5,7), which is part of cluster2 arms. But we drew line. So rule cannot be \"stop only at centers\".\n\nMaybe the rule is that we only draw lines to the nearest 3 that is not part of a cluster that is at the same row or column? That seems arbitrary.\n\nLet's examine the structure: In Example 3, cluster B and cluster D are diagonally aligned: B at (3,6), D at (8,10). The line connecting them passes through (4,7),(5,8),(6,9),(7,10). The nearest 3 along that line is at (7,10). But note that (7,10) is part of cluster D. But maybe we consider that the cluster D's center is at (8,10). The line from B to D's center would be (3,6) to (8,10). The difference is (5,4). That is not a 45-degree diagonal. So the line connecting centers is not a diagonal. So we might only draw lines that connect centers at 45-degree diagonals. In Example 3, cluster B and cluster D are not at 45 degrees. So we don't draw a line between them. But we did draw a line between cluster B and cluster C because they are at 45 degrees. But the line from cluster B to cluster C passes through (4,5),(5,4),(6,3). The nearest 3 along that diagonal is at (6,3) which is center of cluster C. So we drew. So indeed we only draw lines between cluster centers that are at 45 degrees.\n\nBut Example 2: cluster1 and cluster2 are not at 45 degrees. But we drew a line from cluster1 to cluster2's arms. That contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe we misinterpreted cluster2 in Example 2. Let's double-check cluster2 center: In Example 2, cluster2 center at (2,10). But cluster2's arms at (1,10),(2,9),(2,11),(3,10). Wait the cluster shape: Actually cluster2 is a plus shape centered at (2,10). The arms: up at (1,10), down at (3,10), left at (2,9), right at (2,11). So cluster2's center is at (2,10). So cluster1 center at (1,3). The line connecting cluster1 center (1,3) to cluster2 center (2,10) is not diagonal. So we wouldn't draw a line between them. But we did draw a line from cluster1 to cluster2's arm at (5,7). But that line is diagonal. So maybe the rule is: For each cluster center, we draw a diagonal line of 2's from its center to the nearest 3 in that diagonal direction, regardless of whether that 3 is part of a cluster or not. That produced correct output for Example 1 and 2. But for Example 3, we would have drawn extra 2's from cluster B to cluster D's arm at (7,10). So why didn't we? Let's examine cluster B's down-right diagonal again. The first 3 encountered is at (7,10). But maybe we consider that the diagonal from cluster B to (7,10) is blocked by something else? Let's check: Are there any 3's between (3,6) and (7,10) that are not part of cluster B? The cells along the diagonal are (4,7),(5,8),(6,9),(7,10). The first 3 is at (7,10). So we would fill (4,7),(5,8),(6,9). But we didn't.\n\nMaybe the rule is that we only draw lines that connect clusters that are \"adjacent\" in a sense that their arms are adjacent? But cluster B and cluster D are not adjacent. But cluster B and cluster C are adjacent diagonally? Actually cluster B and cluster C are at positions (3,6) and (6,3). They are not adjacent but they are at 45 degrees relative to each other. But they are separated by a diagonal line that goes through (4,5),(5,4),(6,3). The arms of cluster B at (3,5),(3,7),(2,6),(4,6) are not adjacent to cluster C's arms at (5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(6,2),(6,4). But they are separated by a diagonal line of 2's.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is that we draw lines connecting clusters that are the nearest clusters in each diagonal direction? Let's think.\n\nFor each cluster center, we look in each diagonal direction. We find the nearest cluster center in that direction. Then we draw a line of 2's between them. But in Example 3, cluster B's down-right direction: nearest cluster center is cluster D at (8,10) which is at distance (5,4). Not equal row difference and column difference. So not diagonal? But we might still consider it if we consider direction vector (1,1) or (1,-1). The nearest cluster center along that direction is cluster D? Actually we need to see if cluster D is along the down-right direction from cluster B. Down-right direction means moving one step down and one step right each time. The positions along that direction from cluster B are (4,7),(5,8),(6,9),(7,10),(8,11),(9,12), etc. The cluster D center is at (8,10), which is not on that line. So cluster D is not in the down-right direction. So cluster B has no cluster center in down-right direction. So we wouldn't draw line. That matches output. So rule: For each cluster center, find the nearest cluster center along each of the 4 diagonal directions. If found, draw a line of 2's between them, excluding the centers. That would produce correct output for Example 1 and 3. But does it produce output for Example 2? Let's test.\n\nExample 2 cluster centers: center1 (1,3), center2 (2,10), center3 (10,10).\n\n- For center1 (1,3), diagonal directions:\n  - down-right: positions (2,4),(3,5),(4,6),(5,7),(6,8),(7,9),(8,10),(9,11),(10,12),(11,13),(12,14),(13,15). Which cluster center lies on that line? Let's check cluster2 center (2,10) not on that line. cluster3 center (10,10) not on that line. So no cluster center along down-right. So no line.\n\n  - down-left: positions (2,2),(3,1),(4,0). None are cluster centers.\n\n  - up-right: positions (0,4). None.\n\n  - up-left: positions (0,2). None.\n\nThus center1 would not draw any lines. But output had 2's from center1. So rule fails.\n\nThus we need a different rule.\n\nLet's step back. Let's analyze the outputs again. In Example 1, we had lines connecting cluster centers. In Example 2, we had lines connecting cluster centers? Let's analyze cluster centers: center1 (1,3), center2 (2,10), center3 (10,10). Let's check if any two centers are aligned diagonally:\n\n- center1 to center2: difference (1,7). Not diagonal.\n- center1 to center3: difference (9,7). Not diagonal.\n- center2 to center3: difference (8,0). Not diagonal.\n\nThus no diagonally aligned centers. But we still have 2's. So maybe the lines are not between centers but between clusters in some other way.\n\nLet's analyze the positions of 2's in Example 2. They are at (2,4),(3,5),(4,6),(3,9),(4,8). Let's see if these positions form lines between cluster arms or between cluster centers? Let's map the clusters again:\n\nCluster1: center at (1,3). Arms at (0,3),(1,2),(1,4),(2,3).\nCluster2: center at (2,10). Arms at (1,10),(2,9),(2,11),(3,10).\nCluster3: center at (10,10). Arms at (9,10),(10,9),(10,11),(11,10).\n\nNow, 2's positions:\n\n(2,4) is one step down-right from cluster1 center (1,3). So it's along diagonal from cluster1 center to cluster2's arm at (5,7). So that line goes from cluster1 center to cluster2's left arm? Actually cluster2's left arm at (2,9) is not on that line. The line from cluster1 center to cluster2's left arm? Let's check: cluster1 center (1,3) to cluster2 left arm (2,9) difference (1,6). Not diagonal.\n\nBut the line from cluster1 center to cluster2's right arm at (2,11) difference (1,8). Not diagonal.\n\nBut cluster2's center (2,10) is not on that line.\n\nBut the line from cluster1 center to cluster2's down arm at (3,10) difference (2,7). Not diagonal.\n\nSo the 2's from cluster1 center to cluster2's arm at (5,7) we found earlier. That is along diagonal down-right. So we have a line from cluster1 center to cluster2's left arm? Wait cluster2 left arm is at (2,9). That is not on that line. But cluster2's left arm is at (2,9) not at (5,7). Actually cluster2's left arm is at (2,9). But the line from cluster1 center to (5,7) passes through cluster2's left arm? Wait cluster2's left arm at (2,9) is not on that line. The line from cluster1 center (1,3) to (5,7) goes through (2,4),(3,5),(4,6),(5,7). So the 3 at (5,7) is cluster2's left arm? Wait cluster2's left arm is at (2,9). So (5,7) is not part of cluster2. Let's check cluster2's arms: (1,10),(2,9),(2,11),(3,10). So (5,7) is not part of cluster2. Wait we mis-identified cluster2's left arm earlier. Actually cluster2's left arm is at (2,9). So cluster2's arms are at (1,10),(2,9),(2,11),(3,10). So (5,7) is not part of cluster2. So what is (5,7)? It's not a 3 in the input. Wait we need to check the input for Example 2: Let's re-read input lines for Example 2.\n\nInput 2:\n\nRow0: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (0,3)\nRow1: \"0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,10)\nRow2: \"0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (2,3),(2,9),(2,10),(2,11)\nRow3: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (3,10)\nRow4: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (4,7)\nRow5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (5,6),(5,7),(5,8)\nRow6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (6,7)\nRow7: all zeros\nRow8: all zeros\nRow9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (9,10)\nRow10: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (10,9),(10,10),(10,11)\nRow11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\" => 3 at (11,10)\nRow12: all zeros\nRow13: all zeros\n\nSo cluster2 is actually not at (2,10). Wait we mis-labeled cluster2 earlier. Let's identify clusters properly.\n\nWe have plus shapes at:\n\nCluster A: top-left cluster: coordinates (0,3),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3). Center at (1,3). Good.\n\nCluster B: top-right cluster: coordinates (1,10),(2,9),(2,10),(2,11),(3,10). Center at (2,10). Good.\n\nCluster C: bottom-right cluster: coordinates (9,10),(10,9),(10,10),(10,11),(11,10). Center at (10,10). Good.\n\nNow cluster B's arms: left arm at (2,9), right arm at (2,11), up arm at (1,10), down arm at (3,10). So cluster B has no arm at (5,7). So the cell (5,7) is not part of cluster B. So our earlier assumption that the nearest 3 along down-right from center1 is at (5,7) is wrong. Let's recompute: For center1 (1,3), down-right diagonal: (2,4),(3,5),(4,6),(5,7),(6,8),(7,9),(8,10),(9,11),(10,12),(11,13),(12,14),(13,15). Which of these are 3? Let's check each:\n\n- (2,4) 0\n- (3,5) 0\n- (4,6) 0\n- (5,7) 3? Wait row5 col7: row5 is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So row5 col7 is 3. So yes, (5,7) is 3. But we need to confirm: row5 col7 is 3. So (5,7) is part of cluster B's left arm? Wait cluster B's left arm is at (2,9). So (5,7) is not part of cluster B. But it's part of a separate cluster? Actually cluster B's left arm is at (2,9). The cluster at (5,6),(5,7),(5,8) is a separate cluster? Wait row5 has 3's at (5,6),(5,7),(5,8). That looks like a plus shape? Let's examine: (5,6),(5,7),(5,8) are horizontal line of 3's. But we need a plus shape: The cluster at row5 has 3's at (5,6),(5,7),(5,8). But do we have arms up/down/left/right? Let's check row4 col7 is 3. Row6 col7 is 3. So yes, cluster at (5,7) with arms at (4,7),(5,6),(5,8),(6,7). That is a plus shape centered at (5,7). Wait but we didn't identify that cluster earlier. Actually cluster at (5,7) is a plus shape of 3's. Let's confirm:\n\nCoordinates:\n(4,7) 3\n(5,6) 3\n(5,7) 3\n(5,8) 3\n(6,7) 3\n\nYes, that's a plus shape centered at (5,7). So cluster B is not the one at (5,7). There is a cluster at (5,7) as well. So we have actually 4 clusters? Let's check: The top-left cluster (center at (1,3)). The top-right cluster (center at (2,10)). The middle cluster at (5,7). The bottom-right cluster at (10,10). Wait we need to check if the cluster at (5,7) is indeed a plus shape. The plus shape at (5,7) is formed by 3's at (4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(6,7). Yes, that is a plus shape. So we have 4 clusters: A at (1,3), B at (2,10), C at (5,7), D at (10,10).\n\nNow let's see if the output 2's correspond to lines connecting these clusters diagonally. Let's compute cluster centers:\n\n- A: (1,3)\n- B: (2,10)\n- C: (5,7)\n- D: (10,10)\n\nNow let's check pairwise differences:\n\n- A to B: (1,7) not diagonal.\n- A to C: (4,4) difference (4,4). That's a 45-degree diagonal. So we might draw a line from A to C. Let's check: The line from A (1,3) to C (5,7) goes through (2,4),(3,5),(4,6),(5,7). The first 3 encountered along that line? Let's check each cell: (2,4) 0, (3,5) 0, (4,6) 0, (5,7) 3. So we would fill (2,4),(3,5),(4,6). That matches output: 2 at (2,4),(3,5),(4,6). Good.\n\n- A to D: (9,7) not diagonal.\n\n- B to C: (3,-3) difference (3,-3). That's a 45-degree diagonal (down-left). The line from B (2,10) to C (5,7) goes through (3,9),(4,8),(5,7). The first 3 encountered along that line? (3,9) 0, (4,8) 0, (5,7) 3. So we would fill (3,9),(4,8). That matches output: 2 at (3,9),(4,8). Good.\n\n- B to D: (8,0) not diagonal.\n\n- C to D: (5,3) not diagonal.\n\nThus we have exactly 2 lines: from A to C (down-right) and from B to C (down-left). That matches output. So the rule is: For each pair of cluster centers that are diagonally aligned (i.e., difference in row equals difference in column in absolute value), draw a line of 2's between them, excluding the centers. That matches Example 1 and Example 2 and Example 3. Let's test on Example 1: cluster centers at (2,2),(7,7),(11,3). Differences:\n\n- (2,2) to (7,7): diff (5,5) diagonal. So draw line between them: (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6). That matches.\n\n- (2,2) to (11,3): diff (9,1) not diagonal.\n\n- (7,7) to (11,3): diff (4,-4) diagonal. So draw line between them: (8,6),(9,5),(10,4). That matches.\n\n- (7,7) to (2,2) is same as first.\n\n- (11,3) to (2,2) not diagonal.\n\nThus matches output. Example 3: cluster centers at (1,10),(3,6),(6,3),(8,10). Differences:\n\n- (1,10) to (3,6): diff (2,-4) not diagonal.\n\n- (1,10) to (6,3): diff (5,-7) not diagonal.\n\n- (1,10) to (8,10): diff (7,0) not diagonal.\n\n- (3,6) to (6,3): diff (3,-3) diagonal. So line between them: (4,5),(5,4). That matches output.\n\n- (3,6) to (8,10): diff (5,4) not diagonal.\n\n- (6,3) to (8,10): diff (2,7) not diagonal.\n\n- (6,3) to (1,10): diff (-5,7) not diagonal.\n\n- (8,10) to (1,10): diff (-7,0) not diagonal.\n\n- (8,10) to (3,6): diff (-5,-4) not diagonal.\n\n- (8,10) to (6,3): diff (-2,-7) not diagonal.\n\nThus only one line. That matches output.\n\nThus the rule: Identify all plus-shaped clusters of color 3. For each pair of clusters whose centers are at a 45-degree diagonal relative to each other (i.e., difference in row equals difference in column in absolute value), draw a line of color 2 between them, filling cells between the centers along the diagonal path. Exclude the center cells themselves. That seems to match all examples.\n\nNow let's test on the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nWe have a 17x13? Actually let's count: Provided test input grid lines:\n\nRow0: \"0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nRow1: \"0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nRow2: \"0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nRow3: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nRow4: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nRow5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nRow6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\"\nRow7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\"\nRow8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\"\nRow9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nRow10: \"0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nRow11: \"0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nRow12: \"0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nRow13: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\"\nRow14: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\"\nRow15: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\"\nRow16: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nLet's count columns: each row has 13 entries. Yes.\n\nSo we have 13 columns, 17 rows.\n\nNow we need to identify all plus-shaped clusters of 3's.\n\nWe see clusters similar to previous examples: cluster1 at top-left, cluster2 at top-right? Let's examine.\n\nCluster at top-left:\n\nCoordinates: (0,2),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,2). That's a plus shape centered at (1,2). Wait check: Row0 col2 is 3. Row1 col1,2,3 are 3. Row2 col2 is 3. So center at (1,2). Good.\n\nCluster at top-right? Let's see cluster at row6-8 region: Row6 col8 is 3. Row7 col7,8,9 are 3. Row8 col8 is 3. That's a plus shape centered at (7,8). Wait check: Row6 col8 3, Row7 col7,8,9 3, Row8 col8 3. So center at (7,8). Good.\n\nCluster at row10-12 region: Row10 col4 is 3. Row11 col3,4,5 are 3. Row12 col4 is 3. That's a plus shape centered at (11,4). Wait check: Row10 col4 3, Row11 col3,4,5 3, Row12 col4 3. So center at (11,4). Good.\n\nCluster at bottom-right region: Row13 col10 is 3. Row14 col9,10,11 are 3. Row15 col10 is 3. That's a plus shape centered at (14,10). Wait check: Row13 col10 3, Row14 col9,10,11 3, Row15 col10 3. So center at (14,10). Good.\n\nThus we have 4 clusters: A at (1,2), B at (7,8), C at (11,4), D at (14,10). Let's confirm coordinates:\n\n- Cluster A center: (1,2)\n- Cluster B center: (7,8)\n- Cluster C center: (11,4)\n- Cluster D center: (14,10)\n\nNow we need to find all pairs of clusters whose centers are diagonally aligned (difference in row equals difference in column in absolute value). For each such pair, we will draw a line of 2's between them along the diagonal path.\n\nLet's compute differences between each pair:\n\n1. A (1,2) to B (7,8): diff (6,6). That's diagonal. So we draw a line from A to B: cells (2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,6),(6,7),(7,8). But note that (7,8) is the center of B, so we stop before that. So we fill (2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,6),(6,7). These cells should be 2's.\n\n2. A (1,2) to C (11,4): diff (10,2). Not diagonal.\n\n3. A (1,2) to D (14,10): diff (13,8). Not diagonal.\n\n4. B (7,8) to C (11,4): diff (4,-4). That's diagonal. So we draw a line from B to C: cells (8,7),(9,6),(10,5),(11,4). But (11,4) is center of C, so we stop before that. So we fill (8,7),(9,6),(10,5). These cells should be 2's.\n\n5. B (7,8) to D (14,10): diff (7,2). Not diagonal.\n\n6. C (11,4) to D (14,10): diff (3,6). Not diagonal.\n\nThus we have two lines: A->B and B->C. But we must check if any of these lines intersect or overlap? Let's see:\n\n- A->B line: cells: (2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,6),(6,7)\n- B->C line: cells: (8,7),(9,6),(10,5)\n\nThese lines do not overlap. They are separate.\n\nNow we need to produce the output grid: same as input but with 2's at these positions. We need to ensure we don't override any 3's. But we must check if any of these positions are already 3 in input. Let's check:\n\n- (2,3) input: row2 col3 is 0? Input row2: \"0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So col3 is 0. So we can place 2.\n\n- (3,4) input: row3 col4 is 0. So 2.\n\n- (4,5) input: row4 col5 is 0. So 2.\n\n- (5,6) input: row5 col6 is 0. So 2.\n\n- (6,7) input: row6 col7 is 0? Wait row6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\". So col7 is 0. So 2.\n\n- (8,7) input: row8 col7 is 0? Row8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\". So col7 is 0. So 2.\n\n- (9,6) input: row9 col6 is 0? Row9: all zeros. So 2.\n\n- (10,5) input: row10 col5 is 0? Row10: \"0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So col5 is 0. So 2.\n\nThus we will place 2's at those coordinates.\n\nBut we need to confirm that we didn't misinterpret cluster B center: (7,8) correct. Let's double-check cluster B: Row6 col8 is 3, row7 col7,8,9 are 3, row8 col8 is 3. So center at (7,8). Good.\n\nNow cluster C center: (11,4). Good.\n\nNow cluster D center: (14,10). Good.\n\nNow check if any of these lines cross any 3's that are part of other clusters? For example, line from A to B passes through (6,7). Is there any 3 at (6,7)? In input, row6 col7 is 0. So no.\n\nLine from B to C passes through (10,5). Row10 col5 is 0. So no.\n\nThus we can place 2's.\n\nBut we must also check if we need to draw lines in both directions? For each pair, we draw line from the first cluster to the second cluster. But the line is symmetric. We don't need to draw from B to A separately, because it's the same line. So we will only place 2's along each line once.\n\nThus the output grid will be same as input except for the positions (2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,6),(6,7),(8,7),(9,6),(10,5) replaced with 2. Let's produce the output grid.\n\nLet's list each row:\n\nRow0: \"0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" unchanged.\n\nRow1: \"0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" unchanged.\n\nRow2: originally \"0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". We will set col3 to 2. So row2 becomes: \"0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow3: originally \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Set col4 to 2. So row3: \"0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow4: originally \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Set col5 to 2. So row4: \"0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow5: originally \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Set col6 to 2. So row5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow6: originally \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\". Set col7 to 2. So row6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow7: unchanged: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\".\n\nRow8: originally \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\". Set col7 to 2. So row8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow9: originally \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Set col6 to 2. So row9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow10: originally \"0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Set col5 to 2. So row10: \"0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow11: unchanged: \"0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow12: unchanged: \"0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nRow13: unchanged: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\".\n\nRow14: unchanged: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\".\n\nRow15: unchanged: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\".\n\nRow16: unchanged: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nLet's double-check that we didn't accidentally place 2's where there is a 3. For each new 2, confirm input had 0:\n\n- (2,3) input row2 col3 = 0.\n- (3,4) row3 col4 = 0.\n- (4,5) row4 col5 = 0.\n- (5,6) row5 col6 = 0.\n- (6,7) row6 col7 = 0.\n- (8,7) row8 col7 = 0.\n- (9,6) row9 col6 = 0.\n- (10,5) row10 col5 = 0.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow we should double-check that we didn't miss any other diagonal pairs. Let's compute all differences again:\n\n- A to B: diff (6,6) diagonal.\n- A to C: diff (10,2) not diagonal.\n- A to D: diff (13,8) not diagonal.\n- B to C: diff (4,-4) diagonal.\n- B to D: diff (7,2) not diagonal.\n- C to D: diff (3,6) not diagonal.\n\nThus only two lines.\n\nNow we need to check if any of these lines might cross each other? They don't. So we can proceed.\n\nThus the output grid is as above.\n\nLet's produce the final output grid as text:\n\nRow0: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0\nRow7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow10: 0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow11: 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow12: 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\nRow14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\nRow15: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\nRow16: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut we need to ensure that we didn't forget to set (8,7) to 2. Yes we did. Let's double-check row8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0\". Good.\n\nNow let's double-check row9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Good.\n\nNow let's double-check row10: \"0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Good.\n\nNow let's check if any other lines might be needed: maybe we also need to draw line between C and D if they are diagonal? But diff (3,6) not diagonal. So no.\n\nThus final output is as above.\n\nBut we must also check if we need to draw lines between cluster A and cluster C? diff (10,2) not diagonal. So no.\n\nThus final output is correct.\n\nLet's produce the final output grid as lines of numbers separated by spaces.\n\nDouble-check formatting: The input grid uses spaces between numbers. We'll output same.\n\nLet's produce final answer.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0<|return|>"
